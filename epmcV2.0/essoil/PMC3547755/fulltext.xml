These wastes are generated in large amounts throughout the year, and are the most abundant renewable resources on earth. Due to the large availability and composition rich in compounds that could be used in other processes, there is a great interest on the reuse of these wastes, both from economical and environmental view points. The economic aspect is based on the fact that such wastes may be used as low-cost raw materials for the production of other value-added compounds, with the expectancy of reducing the production costs. The environmental concern is because most of the agro-industrial wastes contain phenolic compounds and/or other compounds of toxic potential; which may cause deterioration of the environment when the waste is discharged to the nature. Although the production of bioethanol offers many benefits, more research is needed in the aspects like feedstock preparation, fermentation technology modification, etc., to make bioethanol more economically viable.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Bioethanol</kwd><kwd>Lignocellulosic waste</kwd><kwd>Immobilization</kwd><kwd>Mutagenesis</kwd><kwd>SSF</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Since the late 19<sup>th</sup> century, the mean temperature on earth has increased with 0.8&#x000b0;C and the major part of this increase is likely due to anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases. Carbon dioxide is the type of greenhouse gas with largest emission and this originates from the combustion of fossil fuels as coal, oil and natural gas (Sun and Cheng
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B171">2002</xref>). In USA, transportation accounts for 30% of the total energy consumption. Burning fossil fuels such as coal and oil releases CO<sub>2</sub>, which is a major cause of global warming. With only 4.5% of the world&#x02019;s population, the US is responsible for about 25% of global energy consumption and 25% of global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. The average price of gasoline in 2005 was $2.56 per gallon, which was $0.67 higher than the average price of gasoline in the previous year. Yet in June 2008, the average price of gasoline in the US reached $4.10 per gallon (Kumar et al.
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B92">2009</xref>).</p><p>Soaring oil prices associated with concerns of climate change and national energy security are driving us to utilize sustainable alternative energy sources, such as solar energy, nuclear energy, wind energy, hydropower, tidal energy, and so on (Lynd et al.
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B103">2003</xref>). With the inevitable depletion of world&#x02019;s energy supply, there has been an increasing interest worldwide in alternative sources of energy. Unlike fossil fuels, ethanol is a renewable energy source produced through fermentation of sugars and used as a partial gasoline replacement in a few countries of the world (Sharma et al.
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B152">2007</xref>).</p><p>Bioethanol market is expected to reach 100 x10<sup>9</sup> liters in 2015. The largest producers in the world are the US, Brazil, and China. In 2009, US produced 39.5x10<sup>9</sup> liters of ethanol using corn as a feedstock while the second largest producer, Brazil, created about 30x10<sup>9</sup> liters of ethanol using sugarcane. China is a country that has invested much in the production of ethanol, and is nowadays one of the largest ethanol producers (Ivanova et al.
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">2011</xref>).</p><p>Ethanol contains 35% oxygen, which results in a complete combustion of fuel and thus lowers the emission of harmful gases. Moreover, ethanol production uses energy from renewable sources only; hence, no net carbon dioxide is added to the environment, thus reducing green-house gas emissions. It has also been well established now that ethanol increases the octane number, decreases the Reid vapor pressure and produces fuel with clean burning characteristics (Dhillon et al.
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">2007</xref>). Moreover, neat (unblended) ethanol can be burned with greater efficiency, and is thought to produce smaller amounts of ozone precursors (thus decreasing urban air pollution), and is particularly beneficial with respect to low net CO<sub>2</sub> put into the atmosphere.</p><p>The increasing demand for various industrial purposes such as alternative source of energy, industrial solvents, cleansing agents and preservatives, has necessitated increased production of ethanol (Brooks
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2008</xref>). Furthermore, ethanol by fermentation offers a more favorable trade balance, enhanced energy security, and a major new crop for a depressed agricultural economy. Ethanol is considerably less toxic to humans than is gasoline (or methanol). Ethanol also reduces smog formation because of low volatility; its photochemical reactivity and low production of combustion products. Furthermore, low levels of smog-producing compounds are formed by its combustion (Wyman and Hinman
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B192">1990</xref>). In addition, the low flame temperature of ethanol results in good engine performance.</p><p>Currently, bioethanol is being commercially produced only from edible feedstock such as corn-starch and sugarcane juice. The European Union (EU) had established a goal of 5.75% biomass-derived transportation fuels by December, 2010. The use of fuel ethanol has been quite successful in Brazil, where it is being produced at a very low cost by fermentation of sugarcane. In the US, corn is the dominant biomass feedstock for production of ethanol, and in the EU, straw and other agricultural wastes are the preferred types of biomass for ethanol production (Raposo et al.
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B135">2009</xref>). These bioethanol production systems pose a concern about competition with food and feed supplies. To avoid this competition, bioethanol production from non edible lignocellulosic biomass such as wheat straw, rice straw, bagasse, corn stover, wood, peels of fruits and vegetables is attracting keen interest. The current production and use of bioethanol processes are a starting point. It is our belief that the next generational change in the use of bioresources will come from a total integration of innovative plant resources, synthesis of biomaterials, and generation of biofuels and biopower (Figure

Lignocellulose consists of three major components:</p><p>i. Cellulose, the major constituent of all plant material and the most abundant organic molecule on earth, is a linear biopolymer of anhydroglucopyranose-molecules, connected by &#x003b2;-1, 4-glycosidic bonds. Cellulose or &#x003b2;-1-4-glucan is a linear polysaccharide polymer of glucose made of cellobiose units. The cellulose chains are packed by hydrogen bonds in so-called &#x02018;elementary microfibrils&#x02019;. These fibrils are attached to each other by hemicelluloses, amorphous polymers of different sugars as well as other polymers such as pectin, and covered by lignin. The microfibrils are often associated in the form of bundles or macrofibrils. This special and complicated structure makes cellulose resistant to both biological and chemical treatments. (Delmer and Amor
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">1995</xref>, Morohoshi
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B119">1991</xref>, Ha et al.
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">1998</xref>).</p><p>ii. Hemicellulose, the second most abundant component of lignocellulosic biomass, is a heterogeneous polymer of pentoses (including xylose and arabinose), hexoses (mainly mannose, less glucose and galactose) and sugar acids. Hemicellulose is less complex, its concentration in lignocellulosic biomass is 25 to 35% and it is easily hydrolysable to fermentable sugars (Saha et al.
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B141">2007</xref>). The dominant sugars in hemicelluloses are mannose in softwoods and xylose in hardwoods and agriculture residues (Persson et al.
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B130">2006</xref>, Lavarack et al.
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B96">2002</xref>, Balan et al.
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">2009</xref>).</p><p>iii. Lignin, the third main heterogeneous polymer in lignocellulosic residues, generally contains three aromatic alcohols including coniferyl alcohol, sinapyl and <italic>p</italic>-coumaryl. Lignin serves as a sort of &#x02018;glue&#x02019; giving the biomass fibers its structural strength. Lignin acts as a barrier for any solutions or enzymes by linking to both hemicelluloses and cellulose and prevents penetration of lignocellulolytic enzymes to the interior lignocellulosic structure. Not surprisingly, lignin is the most recalcitrant component of lignocellulosic material to degrade (Zaldivar et al.
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B196">2001</xref>, Hamelinck et al.
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Lignocellulose substrates used for ethanol production</title><p>Sweet sorghum bagasse can be converted efficiently into fermentable sugars (and is a new potential raw material for fuel ethanol production) by SO<sub>2</sub> catalyzed steam pretreatment at 190&#x000b0;C for 10 min or 200&#x000b0;C for 5 min followed by enzymatic hydrolysis with a result of 89-92% glucan conversion (Sipos et al.
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B160">2009</xref>). Hemp and ensiled hemp can be converted into ethanol with steam pretreatment (2% SO<sub>2</sub> catalyst, 210&#x000b0;C for 5 min) followed by simultaneous saccharification and fermentation at high solid loading (7.5% water insoluble solids[WIS]) with a result of 171&#x02013;163 g ethanol/kg raw material (Sipos et al.
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B161">2010</xref>). In Brazil, ethanol is usually produced from cane juice, whereas in USA, starch-crops such as corn are usually used for ethanol production (Sanchez
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B145">2009</xref>). Using sugars or corn as the main source for ethanol production caused a great deal of controversy due to its effect on food production and costs, which has made it difficult for ethanol to become cost competitive with fossil fuels. These concerns became a driving force in the generation of new biofuel research using lignocellulosic wastes produced by many different industries. Apart from corn and cane juice; wheat, oat and barley straw has also been routinely used to produce up to 0.52 million gallons of ethanol per year (Hahn et al.
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">2006</xref>). China is the world&#x02019;s largest sweet potato (<italic>Ipomoea batatas</italic> Lam.) producer (accounting for 85% of global production), with the output exceeded 100 M tons in 2005 (Lu et al.
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B101">2006</xref>). Zhang et al. (
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B197">2011</xref>) reported sweet potato as an attractive feedstock for bioethanol production from both economic and environment friendly standpoints.</p><p>Lignocellulosic wastes are produced in large amounts by different industries including forestry, pulp and paper, agriculture and food, in addition to different wastes from municipal solid waste (MSW), and animal wastes (Sims
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B159">2003</xref>, Kim and Dale

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">2007</xref>, Wen et al.
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B187">2004</xref>). Those derived from agricultural activities include materials such as straw, stem, stalk, leaves, husk, shell, peel, lint, seed/stones, pulp or stubble from fruits, legumes or cereals (rice, wheat, corn, sorghum, barley), bagasses generated from sugarcane or sweet sorghum milling, spent coffee grounds, brewer&#x02019;s spent grains, and many others. These potentially valuable materials were treated as waste in many countries in the past, and still are today in some developing countries, which raises many environmental concerns (Palacios-Orueta et al.
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B124">2005</xref>). Significant efforts, many of which have been successful, have been made to convert these lignocellulosic residues to valuable products such as biofuels, chemicals and animal feed (Howard et al.
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">2003</xref>). Banana peel, an agro waste can be used as a substrate for ethanol production owing to its rich carbohydrate, crude proteins and reducing sugars. Moreover, banana peels are affordable and renewable low cost raw material which makes it potential feedstock for ethanol production (Bhatia and Paliwal
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2010</xref>). Similarly pineapple is the second harvest of importance after bananas, contributing to over 20% of the world production of tropical fruits (Coveca
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">2002</xref>). Thailand, Philippines, Brazil and China are the main pineapple producers in the world supplying nearly 50% of the total output. Other important producers include India, Nigeria, Kenya, Indonesia, M&#x000e9;xico and Costa Rica and these countries provide most of the remaining fruit available (50%). Isitua and Ibeh
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">2010</xref> assayed the feasibility of obtaining ethanol from pineapple waste with the purpose of obtaining a valuable product from the residues of the juice and canning industries.</p><p>Large volume of bagasse is generated during sugarcane processing. Agricultural profitability and environmental protection issues are associated with disposal of bagasse. In recent years, potential efforts have been directed towards the utilization of cheap renewable agricultural resources, such as sugarcane bagasse as alternative substrate for ethanol production (Bhatia and Paliwal
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">2011</xref>). Rice is the major crop grown worldwide with an annual productivity around 800 million metric tonnes that corresponds with the large production of rice straw. In search for viable alternatives of biofuels, paddy straw has been pursued as suitable lignocellulosic waste for ethanol production (Wati et al.
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B186">2007</xref>).</p><p>Feasibility of lignocellulosic material for ethanol production has been explored around the world depending upon availability. Production of ethanol from wheat straw, one of the most abundant agricultural wastes, has been extensively studied (Ballesteros et al.
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">2004</xref>, Curreli et al.
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">2002</xref>, Curreli et al.
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">1997</xref>, Talebnia et al.
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B178">2010</xref>). The average yield of wheat straw is 1.3&#x02013;1.4 lb per lb of wheat grain (Montane et al.
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B117">1998</xref>). According to Ballesteros et al.
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2006</xref>, under the 60% ground cover practice, about 354 millions of tons of wheat straw could be available globally and could produce 104 GL of bioethanol. Europe production would account for about 38% of this world bioethanol capacity. In Spain, grain industry generates important amounts of wheat straw, a part of which is used as bedding straw and the remainder is burned or left on the land to fertilize the soil. Bioconversion of this residue to fuel ethanol would provide an attractive possibility to boost the development of biofuels in a sustainable way.</p></sec><sec><title>Overview of lignocellulosic fermentation</title><p>Schematic picture for the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to ethanol, including the major steps can been seen in Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>. Pretreatment of the lignocellulosic residues is necessary because hydrolysis of non-pretreated materials is slow, and results in low product yield. Some pretreatment methods increase the pore size and reduce the crystallinity of cellulose (Dawson and Boopathy
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">2007</xref>). Pretreatment also makes cellulose more accessible to the cellulolytic enzymes, which in return reduces enzyme requirements and, thus, the cost of ethanol production. The pretreatment not only enhance the bio-digestibility of the wastes for ethanol production, but also results in enrichment of the difficult biodegradable materials, and improves the yield of ethanol from the wastes.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Major steps involved in the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to ethanol (Dashtban et al.</bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">2009</xref><bold>).</bold></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="2191-0855-2-65-2"/></fig><p>Post pretreatment, the recalcitrant lignocellulosic biomass becomes susceptible to acid and/or enzymatic hydrolysis as the cellulosic microfibrils are exposed and/or accessible to hydrolyzing agents (Jacobsen and Wyman
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">2000</xref>). In the pretreatment process, small amounts of cellulose and most of hemicellulose is hydrolyzed to sugar monomers; mainly D-xylose and D-arabinose. The pretreated biomass is then subjected to filtration to separate liquids (hemicellulose hydrolysate) and solid (lignin and cellulose). After detoxification, the liquid is sent to a xylose (pentose) fermentation column for ethanol production. Solids are subjected to hydrolysis (also called second stage hydrolysis). This process is mainly accomplished by enzymatic methods using cellulases. Mild acid hydrolysis using sulfuric and hydrochloric acids is an alternative procedure (Zhang and Lynd
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B199">2004</xref>). The hydrolyzed sugars such as D-glucose, D-galactose, and D-mannose, can be readily fermented to ethanol using various strains of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisae</italic>. The pentoses (D-xylose and D-arabinose) from hemicellulose hydrolysis are not easily utilized by <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> strains; therefore, genetically modified strains of <italic>Pichia stipitis</italic>, <italic>Zymomonas mobilis</italic>, are used for their fermentation. <italic>Candida shehatae</italic> is capable of co-fermenting both pentoses and hexoses to ethanol and other value-added products at high yields (Betancur
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">2005</xref>, Senthilkumar and Gunasekaran
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B150">2005</xref>).</p><p>Numerous pretreatment strategies have been developed to enhance the reactivity of cellulose and to increase the yield of fermentable sugars. Typical goals of pretreatment include:</p><p>i. Production of highly digestible solids that enhances sugar yields during enzyme hydrolysis, avoidance of degradation of sugars (mainly pentoses) including those derived from hemicelluloses.</p><p>ii. Minimization of formation of inhibitors for subsequent fermentation steps.</p><p>iii. Recovery of lignin for conversion into valuable co-products.</p><p>iv. Cost effectiveness by operating in reactors of moderate size and by minimizing heat and power requirements (Mosier et al.

This method of pretreatment being cost effective and ecofriendly, and one on which relatively little work has been done and reported, so far, would form one of the thrust areas of future research.</p><p>Waste materials can be comminuted by a combination of chipping, grinding and milling to reduce cellulose crystallinity. The size of the materials is usually 10&#x02013;30 mm after chipping and 0.2&#x02013;2 mm after milling or grinding. Vibratory ball milling has been found to be more effective in breaking down the cellulose crystallinity of spruce and aspen chips and improving the digestibility of the biomass than ordinary ball milling (Millet et al.
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B116">1976</xref>). The power requirement of mechanical comminution of agricultural materials depends on the final particle size and the waste biomass characteristics (Cadoche and Lopez
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">1989</xref>).</p><p>Pyrolysis has also been used for pretreatment of lignocellulosic materials. When the materials are treated at temperatures greater than 300&#x000b0;C, cellulose rapidly decomposes to produce gaseous products and residual char (Kilzer and Broido
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85">1965</xref>, Shafizadeh and Bradbury
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B155">1979</xref>). The decomposition is much slower and less volatile products are formed at lower temperatures.</p><p>The efficiency of ultrasound in the processing of vegetal materials has been already proved (Vinatoru et al.
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B183">1999</xref>). The known ultrasounds benefits, such as swelling of vegetal cells and fragmentation due to the cavitational effect associated with the ultrasonic treatment, act by increasing the yield and by shortening of the extraction time. The effect of ultrasound on lignocellulosic biomass has been employed in order to improve the extractability of hemicelluloses (Ebringerova et al.
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">2002</xref>), cellulose (Pappas et al.
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B126">2002</xref>), lignin (Sun and Tomkinson
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B170">2002</xref>) or to get clean cellulosic fiber from used paper (Scott and Gerber
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B149">1995</xref>) but only few attempts to improve the susceptibility of lignocellulosic materials to biodegradation by using ultrasound have been described. It was found out that ultrasound has a beneficial effect on saccharification processes (Rolz
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B136">1986</xref>). Sonication has been reported to decrease cellulase requirements by 1/3 to 1/2 and to increase ethanol production from mixed waste office paper by approximately 20% (Wood et al.
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B189">1997</xref>). It was notice that the effect of ultrasound fragmentation of Avicel (microcrystalline cellulose formed by acid treatment) is similar to that of the enzymes for short incubation intervals (Gama et al.
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">1997</xref>). The time needed for ultrasonic treatment could be reduced when increasing the irradiation power (Imai et al.
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Chemical pretreatment methods</title><sec><title>Alkaline pretreatment</title><p>Alkaline pretreatment involves the use of bases, such as sodium, potassium, calcium, and ammonium hydroxide, for the pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass. The use of an alkali causes the degradation of ester and glycosidic side chains resulting in structural alteration of lignin, cellulose swelling, partial decrystallization of cellulose (Cheng et al.
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">2010</xref>, Ibrahim et al.
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">2011</xref>, McIntosh et al.
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B106">2010</xref>) and partial solvation of hemicelluloses (McIntosh et al.
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B106">2010</xref>, Sills et al.
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B158">2011</xref>). Sodium hydroxide has been extensively studied for many years, and it has been shown to disrupt the lignin structure of the biomass, increasing the accessibility of enzymes to cellulose and hemicellulose (MacDonald et al.
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B105">1983</xref>, Soto et al.
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B164">1994</xref>, Zhao et al.,
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B201">2008</xref>). Another alkali that has been used for the pretreatment of biomass is lime. Lignocellulosic feedstocks that have been shown to benefit from this method of pretreatment are corn stover, switchgrass, bagasse, wheat, and rice straw.</p><p>The conditions for alkaline pretreatment are usually less severe than other pretreatments. It can be performed at ambient conditions, but longer pretreatment times are required than at higher temperatures. The advantage of lime pretreatment is that the cost of lime required for pretreatment of a given quantity of biomass is lowest among alkaline treatments. Most commonly used alkali in the alkali pretreatment processes are NaOH and Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>. This process results in (i) the removal of all lignin and part of hemicellulose, and (ii) increased reactivity of cellulose in further hydrolysis steps (Hamelinck et al.

The most commonly used acid is dilute sulphuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>), which has been commercially used to pre-treat a wide variety of biomass types-switchgrass, corn stover, spruce (softwood), and poplar. Acid pretreatment (removal of hemicellulose) followed by alkali pretreatment (removal of lignin) has shown to yield relatively pure cellulose (Wingren et al.
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B188">2003</xref>, Taherzadeh and Karimi
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B176">2008</xref>). Strong acid allows complete breakdown of the components in the biomass to sugars, but also requires large volumes of concentrated sulfuric acid and can result in the production of furfural, an inhibitory byproduct (Goldstein and Easter
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">1992</xref>). Dilute acid allows reduced acid concentrations, but requires higher temperatures, and again gives furfural.</p><p>A key advantage of acid pretreatment is that a subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis step is sometimes not required, as the acid itself hydrolyses the biomass to yield fermentable sugars (Zhu et al.
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B202">2009</xref>). A mixture of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and acetic acid resulted in 90% saccharification (DeMoraes-Racha et al.
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">2010</xref>). Hemicellulose and lignin are solubilized with minimal degradation, and the hemicellulose is converted to sugars with acid pretreatment. The major drawback to these acid processes is the cost of acid and the requirement to neutralize the acid after treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Wet oxidation</title><p>Wet oxidation utilizes oxygen as an oxidizer for compounds dissolved in water. Typically, the procedure for wet oxidation consists of drying and milling lignocellulosic biomass to obtain particles that are 2 mm in length, to which water is added at a ratio of 1 L to 6 g biomass. Wet oxidation has been used to fractionate lignocellulosic material by solubilizing hemicellulose and removing lignin (Martin et al.

Wet oxidation combined with base addition readily oxidizes lignin from wheat straw, thus making the polysaccharides more susceptible to enzymatic hydrolysis.

Ionic liquid (IL) was found to possess a great potential in dissolving cellulose (Swatloski et al.

Ionic liquids are salts, typically composed of a small anion and a large organic cation, which exist as liquids at room temperature and have very low vapor pressure.

Hydrolysis kinetics of the IL-treated cellulose was significantly enhanced. A limitation in using ionic liquids is the fact they tend to inactivate cellulose.</p><p>A solvent which has been effective in dissolution of cellulose and has a low vapor pressure similar to that of the ionic liquids is N-methyl morpholine N-oxide (NMMO). NMMO retains all the advantages of the ionic liquids ability to dissolve a variety of lignocellulosic substrates (Kuo and Lee

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B137">2001</xref>). Further research is needed to evaluate and improve the economics of usage of ILs and NMMO for pretreatment of biomass. Pretreatment of lignocellulosic materials with acidified organic solvents (mixture of 80% ethylene glycol, 19.5% water and 0.5% HCl at 178&#x000b0;C for 90 min) has also been successfully used (Yamashita et al.
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B193">2010</xref>).The advantages of these methods include recovery and recycling of organic solvents as they can be easily distilled out.

This hydrothermal pretreatment method subjects the material to high pressures and temperatures for a short duration of time after which it rapidly depressurizes the system, disrupting the structure of cellulose microfibrils. The disruption of the fibrils increases the accessibility of the cellulose to the enzymes during hydrolysis.</p><p>Steam explosion is typically initiated at a temperature of 160&#x02013;260&#x000b0;C (corresponding pressure 0.69&#x02013;4.83 MPa) for several seconds to a few minutes before the material is exposed to atmospheric pressure. The process causes hemicellulose degradation and lignin transformation due to high temperature, thus increasing the potential of cellulose hydrolysis (Ballesteros et al.

Furthermore, expensive reactor systems have not been necessary to use due to the low corrosive nature of this pretreatment technique. Neutralization of degradation products is not needed due to their fractionation and utilization in the liquid fraction. In the same sense, inhibitory products have not been reported to form overwhelmingly in the respective fractions allowing higher yields under specific conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>Ammonia fiber explosion (AFEX)</title><p>The ammonia fiber/freeze explosion (AFEX) process is another physicochemical process, much like steam explosion pretreatment, in which the biomass material is subjected to liquid anhydrous ammonia under high pressures and moderate temperatures and is then rapidly depressurized.

An overview of some of the advantages include lower moisture content, lower formation of sugar degradation products due to moderate conditions, 100% recovery of solid material, and the ability for ammonia to lessen lignin&#x02019;s effect on enzymatic hydrolysis. A smaller number of disadvantages can be seen in the form of higher costs due to recycle and treatment of chemicals that are being used.</p></sec><sec><title>Ammonia recycle percolation (ARP)</title><p>Ammonia recycle percolation (ARP) has been paired with the AFEX pretreatment process by many authors, but it can have some different characteristics that need to be taken into consideration when looking at different pretreatment options (Kim and Lee

In this process, aqueous ammonia of concentration between 5-15% (wt%) is sent through a packed bed reactor containing the biomass feedstock at a rate of about 5 ml/min. The advantage with this process over AFEX is its ability to remove a majority of the lignin (75&#x02013;85%) and solubilize more than half of the hemicellulose (50&#x02013;60%) while maintaining high cellulose content (Kim and Lee

Thus, SCF has the ability to penetrate the crystalline structure of lignocellulosic biomass overcoming the mass transfer limitations encountered in other pretreatments.

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">2003</xref>) reported that addition of surfactants as an additive in SSF can significantly lower the operational cost of the process because it increases the conversion rate of cellulose to glucose. Addition of Tween-20, 2.5 g/l not only reduces the time required to attain maximum ethanol concentration, but also enhances enzyme activity in the liquid fraction at the end of SSF, probably by preventing unproductive binding of the cellulases to lignin, which could facilitate enzyme recovery.</p><p>Over the years, various groups have worked on the SSF process to improve the choice of enzymes, fermentative microbes, biomass pretreatment, and process conditions.

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">2012</xref>) developed a cheap and rapid approach for ethanol quantification in aqueous media during fermentation steps as part of the conversion of biomass to ethanol. The suggested method requires a sample of a small volume and consists of organic extraction, followed by direct use of gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector (GC-FID). The feasibility of such approach is obvious since there is no need for the head-space system, distillation, expensive reagents and sophisticated equipment. The proposed method was also tested for its &#x02018;real-life&#x02019; applicability for ethanol quantification from fermentation process.</p><p>According to Keller and Bryan (
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84">2000</xref>), distillation is still a &#x0201c;formidable competitor&#x0201d; as a major separation method even though much research has been thrust on its alternatives. Hence, distillation, especially simple distillation, tends to be the first choice in industry for separating a liquid mixture; other methods, including complex distillation, e.g., azeotropic distillation, come into play only when simple distillation is deemed to be technically infeasible or economical inviable because of typically three large stainless steel distillation towers, stainless steel heat exchangers and price of stainless up 400% in last six years, high operating costs because 280 MMBTU/hr energy is consumed (100 MGPY ethanol). Mole sieve drying adds to energy costs and that&#x02019;s why energy costs up significantly with price of crude oil.</p><p>Under certain circumstances, retrofitting of an existing process can be economically far more viable than constructing a new process, especially when the financial resources are limited and/or when short term needs are to be met under a tight time constraint. Developing economically viable fermentation processes requires efficient downstream processing: selective product removal and avoiding byproduct streams. &#x0201c;ESepis a modular, low-energy process for the recovery of ethanol from fermentation broth with an estimated reduction of up to 60% in both capital and operating costs versus conventional distillation. Use of non-stainless steel components also results in a substantial reduction in construction time&#x0201d;. It is applicable to new ethanol plants (corn, sugar and cellulosic). It replaces whole distillation train and mole sieve dryer. With new plants it reduces overall energy consumption by &#x0003e;60% (ESep

The modeling and optimization of the process using MINLP tools showed 12% savings in the production costs considering a 32% increase in membrane area and the reduction in both reflux ratio and ethanol concentration in the distillate of the column (Lelkes et al.
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B97">2000</xref>, Szitkai et al.
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B175">2002</xref>). Through pilot-plant studies, the integration of distillation process with the pervaporation has been achieved resulting in good indexes in terms of energy savings. These savings are due to the low operation costs of pervaporation and to the high yield of dehydrated ethanol, typical of pervaporation processes (Tsuyomoto et al.
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B180">1997</xref>). The comparison between azeotropic distillation using benzene and pervaporation system using multiple membrane modules showed that, at the same ethanol production rate and quality (99.8 wt.%), operation costs, including the membrane replacement every 2&#x02013;4 years, are approximately 1/3&#x02013;1/4 of those of azeotropic distillation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods used to improve fungal enzyme production, activity and/or stability</title><p>In order to produce ethanol industrially, the fermentative microorganism needs to be robust.

Cellulolytic activity of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>reesei</italic> QM6a has been improved by using different mutagenesis techniques including UV-light and chemicals, resulting in the mutant QM 9414 with higher filter paper activity (FPA) (Mandels et al.
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B109">1971</xref>). <italic>T</italic>. <italic>reesei</italic> RUT-C30 is one of the best known mutants, producing 4&#x02013;5 times more cellulase than the wild-type strain (QM 6a). A recent study by Kovacs et al.

Moreover, <italic>T</italic>. <italic>atroviride</italic> mutants were created by mutagenesis using <italic>N</italic>-methyl-<italic>N</italic>&#x02019;-nitro-<italic>N</italic>-nitrosoguanidine (NTG) as well as UV-light. These <italic>T</italic>. <italic>atroviride</italic> mutants (e.g. <italic>T</italic>. <italic>atroviride</italic> TUB F-1724) produce high levels of extracellular cellulases as well as &#x003b2;-glucosidase when they are grown on pretreated willow. Cellulase and xylanase activities in <italic>Penicillium verruculosum</italic> 28 K mutants were improved about 3-fold using four cycles of UV mutagenesis. The enzyme production was further improved by 2- to 3-fold in a two-stage fermentation process using wheat bran, yeast extract medium and microcrystalline cellulose as the inducer (Soloveva et al.
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B163">2005</xref>).</p><p>Site-directed mutagenesis (SDM) plays a central role in the characterization and improvement of cellulases including their putative catalytic and binding residues. The application of SDM it was found that Glu 116 and 200 are the catalytic nucleophile and acid&#x02013;base residues in <italic>Hypocrea jecorina</italic> (anamorph <italic>T</italic>. <italic>reesei</italic>) Cel12A, respectively. In the study, mutant enzymes were produced where Glu was replaced by Asp or Gln at each position (E116D/Q and E200D/Q). The specific activity of these mutants was reduced by more than 98%, suggesting the critical role of these two residues in the catalytic function of the enzyme (Okada et al.
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B123">2000</xref>). In another study, the thermostable endo-1,4-&#x003b2;-xylanase (XynII) mutants from <italic>T</italic>. <italic>reesei</italic> were further mutated to resist inactivation at high pH by using SDM. All mutants were resistant to thermal inactivation at alkaline pH. For example, thermotolerance for one mutant (P9) at pH 9 was increased approximately 4&#x02013;5&#x000b0;C, resulting in better activity in sulphate pulp bleaching compared to the reference (Fenel et al.
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">2006</xref>). Also, the catalytic efficiency and optimum pH of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>reesei</italic> endo-&#x003b2;-1,4-glucanase II were improved by saturation mutagenesis followed by random mutagenesis and two rounds of DNA shuffling. The pH optimum of the variant (Q139R/L218H/W276R/N342T) was shifted from 4.8 to 6.2, while the enzyme activity was improved more than 4.5-fold (Qin et al.

Moreover, the stability of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>reesei</italic> endo-1,4-&#x003b2;-xylanases II (XynII) was increased by engineering a disulfide bridge at its N-terminal region. In fact, two amino acids (Thr-2 and Thr-28) in the enzyme were substituted by cysteine (T2C:T28C mutant) resulting in a 15&#x000b0;C increase in thermostability (Fenel et al.
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Co-culturing</title><p>Fungal co-culturing offers a means to improve hydrolysis of lignocellulosic residues, and also enhances product utilization which minimizes the need for additional enzymes in the bioconversion process. In the case of cellulose degradation, for example, all three enzymatic components (EG, CBH and &#x003b2;-glucosidase) have to be present in large amounts. However, none of the fungal strains, including the best mutants, are able to produce high levels of the enzymes at the same time. <italic>T</italic>. <italic>reesei</italic> for example produces CBH and EG in high quantities whereas its &#x003b2;-glucosidase activity is low (Stockton et al.

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B93">2008</xref>). In addition, hemicellulose hydrolysis must also be considered when lignocellulosic residues are subjected to biomass conversion. However, this will be determined by the pretreatment methods. Specifically in an alkali pretreatment method, a part of lignin will be removed and thus hemicellulose has to be degraded by the use of hemicellulases, whereas in acid-catalyzed pretreatment, the hemicellulose layer will be hydrolyzed (Hahn et al.
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">2006</xref>). Again, some fungal strains have been shown to work more efficiently on cellulosic residues whereas others produce more hemicellulolytic enzymes and efficiently hydrolyze hemicellulosic portions (Howard et al.
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">2003</xref>). Conversion of both cellulosic and hemicellulosic hydrolytic products in a single process can be achieved by co-culturing two or more compatible microorganisms with the ability to utilize the materials. In fact, in nature, lignocellulosic residues are degraded by multiple co-existing lignocellulolytic microorganisms.</p><p>Mixed fungal cultures have many advantages compared to their monocultures, including improving productivity, adaptability and substrate utilization.

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">1995</xref>). In the both cases, enzyme activity for cellulases and hemicellulases was significantly increased. The main drawback of co-culturing however is the complexity of growing multiple microorganisms in the same culture (Lynd et al.

Thus, reaction&#x02013;separation integration by removing ethanol from the zone where the biotransformation takes place, offers several opportunities for increasing product yield and consequently reducing product costs. Other forms of integration may significantly decrease energetic costs of specific flowsheet configurations for ethanol production. Process integration is gaining more and more interest due to the advantages related to its application in the case of ethanol production: reduction of energy costs, decrease in the size and number of process units, intensification of the biological and downstream processes. Integration of fermentation and separation processes for reduction of product inhibition, development of efficient cogeneration technologies using cane bagasse, development of CBP, application of membrane technology (e.g. for ethanol removal or dehydration) are examples of process integration.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Lignocellulolytic microorganisms, especially fungi, have attracted a great deal of interest as biomass degraders for large-scale applications due to their ability to produce large amounts of extracellular lignocellulolytic enzymes. Many successful attempts have been made to improve fungal lignocellulolytic activity including recombinant and non-recombinant techniques. Process integration has also been considered for the purpose of decreasing the production cost, which was partly achieved by performing hydrolysis and fermentation in a single reactor (SSF) using one or more microorganisms (co-culturing).</p><p>These laboratory improvements should now be verified in pilot and demonstration plants. Scaling up the production of lignocellulosic ethanol, however, requires further reduction of the production cost. Thus, in order to improve the technology and reduce the production cost, two major issues have to be addressed: i) improving technologies to overcome the recalcitrance of cellulosic biomass conversion (pretreatment, hydrolysis and fermentation) and ii) sustainable production of biomass in very large amounts.</p><sec><title>Future prospects</title><p>It is considered that lignocellulosic waste will become the main feedstock for ethanol production in the near future. In the case of large scale biomass production, additional waste stocks can be tested and used as substrates to meet the needs. On the other hand, biotechnological approaches including systems biology and computational tools are likely good candidates to overcome these issues. Future trends for costs reduction should include more efficient pretreatment of biomass, improvement of specific activity and productivity of cellulases, improvement of recombinant microorganisms for a greater assimilation of all the sugars released during the pretreatment and hydrolysis processes, and further development of co-generation system. Undoubtedly, ongoing research on genetic and metabolic engineering will make possible the development of effective and stable strains of microorganisms for converting cellulosic biomass into ethanol. Process engineering will play a central role for the generation, design, analysis and implementation of technologies improving the indexes of global process, or for the retrofitting of employed bioprocesses. Undoubtedly, process intensification through integration of different phenomena and unit operations as well as the implementation of consolidated bioprocessing of different feedstocks into ethanol (that requires the development of tailored recombinant microorganisms), will offer the most significant outcomes during the search of the efficiency in fuel ethanol production. This fact will surely imply a qualitative improvement in the industrial production of fuel ethanol in the future.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec></body><back><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors are thankful to Chancellor, ITM University, Gwalior, MP, and Dr. J.L.
