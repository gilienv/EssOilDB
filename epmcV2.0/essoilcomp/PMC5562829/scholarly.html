Abstract</div> <p> <i>Alternaria</i> species produce various sorts of toxic metabolites during their active growth and causes severe diseases in many plants by limiting their productivity. These toxic metabolites incorporate various mycotoxins comprising of dibenzo-α-pyrone and some tetramic acid derivatives. In this study, we have screened out total 48 isolates of <i>Alternaria</i> from different plants belonging to different locations in India, on the basis of their pathogenic nature. Pathogenicity testing of these 48 strains on susceptible tomato variety (CO-3) showed 27.08% of the strains were highly pathogenic, 35.41% moderately pathogenic and 37.5% were less pathogenic. Phylogenetic analysis showed the presence of at least eight evolutionary cluster of the pathogen. Toxins (TeA, AOH and AME) were isolated, purified on the basis of column chromatography and TLC, and further confirmed by the HPLC-UV chromatograms using standards. The final detection of toxins was done by the LC-MS/MS analysis by their mass/charge ratio. The present study develops an approach to classify the toxicogenic effect of each of the individual mycotoxins on tomato plant and focuses their differential susceptibility to develop disease symptoms. This study represents the report of the natural occurrence and distribution of <i>Alternaria</i> toxins in various plants from India. </p> </div> <div class="custom-meta-group" title="custom-meta-group"> <meta name="issue-copyright-statement" value="© The Author(s) 2017" /> </div> </div> </div> <div class="body" title="body"> <div class="introduction" title="introduction"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Introduction</div> <p> <i>Alternaria</i> is one of the most common fungal genera found ubiquitously and comprises of species which may be saprophytic, endophytic or pathogenic in nature. The small spores of this pathogen are distributed everywhere where they can deteriorate food quality and quantity, and decrease their nutritive profile by producing some potent toxic metabolites and hence degrade the economic values of food products and other animal feedstuffs. As phytopathogens, they can cause severe problems in agriculture by reducing crop yield, thus causing considerable economic losses to farmers and food processing industries <sup> <a href="#CR1">1</a>– <a href="#CR3">3</a> </sup>. The phytotoxic effect first appears in leaves followed by their progressive contamination to fruits hence deteriorating the tomato fruits, affecting pulp quality and overall decreasing the fruit quantity and quality at harvesting stage hence decreasing the economic value of fruits. The diseased symptoms develops during pathogenesis is due to the phytotoxicity of fungal metabolites produced during their active growth <sup> <a href="#CR4">4</a> </sup> and has been demonstrated through many preliminary studies <sup> <a href="#CR3">3</a>, <a href="#CR5">5</a> </sup>. </p> <p>Toxic metabolites secreted by <i>Alternaria</i> species can be categorized into three major structural categories <sup> <a href="#CR3">3</a>, <a href="#CR5">5</a> </sup> (i) Dibenzo-α-pyrone derivatives which are exemplified by alternariol (AOH), alternariol monomethyl ether (AME) and altenuene (ALT); (ii) Perylene derivatives which includes altertoxins (ATX-I, -II and -III) and (iii) Tetramic acid derivative which contain tenuazonic acid (TeA). The chemical composition of three mycotoxins commonly produced by <i>Alternaria</i> species are; (i) AOH (C <sub>14</sub>H <sub>10</sub>O <sub>5</sub>): 3,7,9-trihydroxy-1-methyl-6 <i>H</i>-dibenzo( <i>b,d</i>)pyran-6-one; M.W. 258; (ii) AME (C <sub>15</sub>H <sub>12</sub>O <sub>5</sub>): 3,7-dihydroxy-9-methoxy-1-methyl-6 <i>H</i>-dibenzo( <i>b,d</i>)pyran-6-one; M.W. 272; (iii) TeA (C <sub>10</sub>H <sub>15</sub>O <sub>3</sub>N): 3-acetyl-5- <i>sec</i>-butyl-4-hydroxy-3-pyrrolin-2-one; M.W. 197. </p> <p>TeA, iso-tenuazonic acid, and their salts exhibit herbicidal activity with broad spectrum properties, quick killing, and high efficiency for plants <sup> <a href="#CR6">6</a> </sup>. TeA was also found in Canadian lentils, and in recently found in beer and cereal foods <sup> <a href="#CR7">7</a>– <a href="#CR10">10</a> </sup>. The addition of adjuvants improves the herbicidal activity of these compounds. Recently, many <i>in vitro</i> studies have reported that AOH causes DNA damage by inducing cell cycle arrest <sup> <a href="#CR11">11</a>, <a href="#CR12">12</a> </sup> which leads to mutations in living beings <sup> <a href="#CR13">13</a>– <a href="#CR15">15</a> </sup>. Furthermore, AOH also exhibits cytotoxic, foetotoxic, mutagenic and teratogenic effects that is responsible for the etiology of oesophageal cancer <sup> <a href="#CR16">16</a> </sup>. It has been showed that both AME and AOH have potential carcinogenic, genotoxic and cytotoxic activity in both microbial and mammalian cell system <sup> <a href="#CR16">16</a> </sup>. According to Graf <i>et al</i>. <sup> <a href="#CR17">17</a> </sup> in case of <i>Alternaria alternata</i>, an external addition of alternariol restored the pathogenicity. Many other fungal genera such as <i>Stagonospora nodorum</i> <sup> <a href="#CR18">18</a> </sup> and <i>Phomopsis</i> isolates <sup> <a href="#CR19">19</a> </sup> have also been found to produce AOH and AME. TeA is also produced by other species of fungi including, <i>Pyricularia oryzae</i> and <i>Phoma sorghina</i> <sup> <a href="#CR3">3</a>, <a href="#CR20">20</a>– <a href="#CR22">22</a> </sup>. </p> <p>During the last decade, there is growing interest in isolation, purification and characterization of <i>Alternaria</i> toxins. <i>Alternaria</i> mycotoxins have been frequently isolated and reported in fruits and vegetables, such as tomatoes, citrus fruits, Japanese pears, prune nectar, red currant, carrots, barley, oats, olives, mandarins, melons, peppers, apples, raspberries, cranberries, grapes, sunflower seeds, oilseed rape meals, flax seeds, linseeds, pecans, melons, lentils, wheat and other grains <sup> <a href="#CR1">1</a>– <a href="#CR3">3</a>, <a href="#CR5">5</a>, <a href="#CR23">23</a>– <a href="#CR29">29</a> </sup>. Recently <i>Alternaria</i> mycotoxins have been analysed and determined using some of the advanced, highly developed and separation techniques such as thin-layer chromatography (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), high performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC), and gas chromatography (GC) techniques <sup> <a href="#CR30">30</a>– <a href="#CR33">33</a> </sup>. However, in all the above techniques HPLC is the most extensively used technique for the detection of <i>Alternaria</i> toxins <sup> <a href="#CR3">3</a>, <a href="#CR25">25</a>, <a href="#CR27">27</a>, <a href="#CR34">34</a> </sup>. In the present time, LC-MS/MS is highly selective, sensitive, and accurate technique for mycotoxin determination in both biological <sup> <a href="#CR35">35</a>, <a href="#CR36">36</a> </sup> and food samples <sup> <a href="#CR37">37</a> </sup>. </p> <p>Recent investigations have explored the availability of different mycotoxins isolated from <i>Alternaria</i> confined to different geographical regions of the world. However, very inadequate information is available for <i>Alternaria</i> pathogen recovered from Indian subcontinent. The broad spectrum pathogenicity of the isolates recovered from different locations is determined by various environmental parameters. Overall the differential host response in the presence of host defense mechanisms against pathogens determines the degree of susceptibility or resistance of host plants. The isolation, purification and characterization of different mycotoxins provide information regarding the severity of the pathogen and its toxic effects caused by the cumulative action of all these toxins. The individual action of single mycotoxin for disease development is incurred by its efficiency and the degree of damages. In this regard, the effect of each toxic component varies among different isolates. The elucidation of the functional pathway lies behind the biogenesis, action mechanism, signalling cascades involved and the relevant host mediated defense response in presence of these mycotoxins will assist pathogen controlling and disease development. </p> <p>The present research work focuses on the isolation, identification and characterisation of different mycotoxins by various liquid chromatography (LC) techniques from different isolates of <i>Alternaria</i> species. The study also investigates the differential toxic effect of these isolates against tomato plant, and the efficiency and potential of each of the three mycotoxins TeA, AOH and AME in disease development. </p> </div> <div class="results" title="results"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Morphological identification</div> <p>A total of 60 isolates of <i>Alternaria</i> have been isolated from various regions in India. Out of them 48 isolates of <i>Alternaria</i> were selected in the present study on the basis of their high pathogenic nature. Microscopic examination was made to identify these 48 isolates on the basis of sporulation pattern on culture plates (Supplementary Fig. <a href="#MOESM2">S1</a>). Further, these isolates were confirmed on the basis of their morphological characteristics including length of primary conidiophores, branching patterns, origin of branching, conidial shapes, size and colour with ornamentation pattern. <i>Alternaria</i> species were identified by employing compound microscope at 40X magnification with following standard manuals <sup> <a href="#CR38">38</a>, <a href="#CR39">39</a> </sup>. The isolates were identified as belonging to <i>Alternaria</i> genera on the basis of some morphological characteristics like conidial structure, presence or absence of septa, septation pattern as mentioned in relevant scientific literatures describing key morphological characteristics available for <i>Alternaria</i> (Fig. <a href="#Fig1">1</a> and Table <a href="#Tab1">1</a>). The <i>Alternaria</i> isolates exhibited a high level of diversity in terms of culture and morphology. The colour of the colonies and the conidia grown on potato dextrose agar (PDA) media showed some variations. The colour of isolated <i>Alternaria</i> species varies such as light green, black green, light grey, olive brown-green, brown, white cottony and some other, which was given in Table <a href="#Tab1">1</a>. The conidia were different shapes like as long obpyriform in shape with long beak, obclavate with rounded at the apex, long and small conidia with germinating tubes, some were brown with rounded apex, some were moderate in size etc. The isolates of <i>Alternaria</i> species showed significant morphological variability in respect of conidia length, conidia width and number of septa (transverse/longitudinal septa) (Table <a href="#Tab2">2</a>). The average conidial length, which varied from 18.76 to 54.77 μm, was highest in Rohtak, Haryana mustard leaf isolated strain (MT 3; KX139154) that is, 54.77 μm and lowest in Jaunpur, Uttar Pradesh tomato leaf isolated strain (TM 11) that is, 18.76 μm. Average conidial width, which varied from 4.10 to 7.90 μm, was highest in TM 11 isolates that is 7.90 μm and lowest in Jaunpur, Uttar Pradesh isolate parthenium leaf isolated strain (PR 2; KX139166) that is, 4.10 μm. The average number of transverse septa, which varied from 1.33 to 8.67, was highest in MT 3 isolates that is 8.67 and lowest in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh tomato leaf isolated strain (TM 1; KX179477) that is, 1.33. While, the average number of longitudinal septa, which varied from 1.0 to 4.67, was highest in Satna, Madhya Pradesh mustard leaf isolated strain (MT 5; KX139155) that is 4.67 and lowest in TM 1 isolates that is, 1.0. </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"> <a href="http://doi.org/"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Figure 1</span> </a> </div>   <p>Morphological characteristics, growth pattern, colony morphology and microscopic examination of three potent toxic isolates of <i>Alternaria</i> species collected from different regions in India.

Pathogenicity test</div> <p>All the isolates were tested for their pathogenicity on tomato, mustard, brinjal and potato plants following Koch’s postulates. It was observed that a greater degree of variation exist between host plants. However, the maximum pathogenic effect was recorded in case of tomato ( <i>Lycopersicon esculentum</i>). The symptoms of the disease as observed in selected host plants were characterized by black sunken necrotic lesions having typical concentric rings increasing gradually and covering maximum area of the leaves when compared to untreated control samples. A comparison was made between all the sample host plants and it was interpreted that the pathogen causes maximum damage to tomato plants as it covers almost 75–80% area of the whole leaf affected within 4–5 days followed by mustard, potato and lastly brinjal indicating the choice for host specificity for <i>Alternaria</i> pathogen. The pathogenic effect was found to be prevalent and significant in case of tomato plants hence, the tomato plant was chosen for further study. The <i>Alternaria</i> isolates examined had differences in the disease severity on test tomato (CO-3) variety. Based on the mean disease severity (MDS), the virulence of each isolate was recorded as low (MDS: 10–30%), moderate (MDS: 30–60%) or high (MDS: 60–100%). The isolates were thus categorized into 3 groups viz., highly pathogenic (13 isolates), moderately pathogenic (17 isolates), less pathogenic (18 isolates) based on the symptomatological variations in the test tomato variety (Table <a href="#Tab1">1</a>). The uninoculated tomato plants leaves showed no symptoms. All <i>Alternaria</i> isolates were successfully reisolated from disease-affected plants, thereby completing Koch’s postulates. </p> </div> <div class="itssequenceanalysis" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
ITS sequence analysis</div> <p>The ITS region was successfully amplified from DNA from all <i>Alternaria</i> isolates in the study by the fungal-specific universal primer pairs ITS1 (forward) and ITS4 (reverse). The lengths of sequences as determined by capillary electrophoresis ranged from 500 bp to 600 bp (Supplementary Fig. <a href="#MOESM2">S2</a>). The obtained rDNA sequences were analyzed using NCBI-BLAST. The BLAST analysis of the ITS rDNA sequence data, supported the morphological identification, whereby the closest match (99–100% similarity) in the NCBI GenBank database was found to be with different <i>Alternaria</i> species. The ITS rDNA sequences of the 48 isolates have been deposited in the NCBI GenBank database (GenBank Accession numbers were given in Table <a href="#Tab1">1</a>). The BLAST results confirmed the different species of <i>Alternaria</i> and the alignment of the sequences was done using CLC Sequence Viewer 6.8.2. (Supplementary Fig. <a href="#MOESM2">S2</a>). </p> <p>A dendrogram was constructed on the basis of ITS sequences using Clustal W and MEGA 5.0 software by Neighbour-Joining method (Fig. <a href="#Fig2">2</a>). The phylogenetic tree of genus <i>Alternaria</i> investigated in this study was clearly clustered into eight groups. The cluster I is the major group which contains <i>Alternaria alternata</i> as a dominant species (Fig. <a href="#Fig2">2</a>). Cluster III showed three species <i>Alternaria brassicae</i> strain BHU-LMMT21, <i>Alternaria alternata</i> strain BHU-LMMT03, and <i>Alternaria brassicicola</i> strain BHU-LMMT12 which were similar to each other. Since <i>Alternaria alternata</i> was found in all clusters in phylogenetic tree which showed polyphyletic nature of <i>Alternaria alternata</i>. Cluster VIII have two species of <i>Alternaria</i> i.e., <i>Alternaria</i> sp. 3 MM-2016 and <i>Alternaria</i> sp. 4 MM-2016, which was not supported by maximum bootstrap value it means theses two isolates ( <i>Alternaria</i> sp. 3 MM-2016 and <i>Alternaria</i> sp. 4 MM-2016) might be new species. </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"> <a href="http://doi.org/"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Figure 2</span> </a> </div>   <p>Phylogenetic relationship based on 18S rDNA sequences of different isolated <i>Alternaria</i> species.

Thin layer chromatography analysis of <i>Alternaria</i> toxins </div> <p>Thin layer chromatography (TLC) analysis was done for qualitative determination and characterization of mycotoxins recovered from culture filtrates of different isolates.

Assessment of efficiency of toxicological effects of different mycotoxins (TeA, AOH and AME) </div> <p>The toxic effect induced by each of the three mycotoxins differs among different isolates and a remarkable difference has been observed in the efficiency of separate mycotoxins in causing cell damages and cell death at varying time interval. Three toxins namely TeA, AOH and AME were given separate treatment on different leaf samples of tomato plants. The necrotic region developed clearly indicates the extent of damages caused by these toxins. The extent of tissue damages was measured or expressed in the form of percentage area covered under necrotic regions during the time interval. The results obtained through this study indicates that TeA caused maximum damages and contributes maximum percentage to cell damages at all intervals of time followed by AOH and lastly AME when compared to control leaf samples having almost no tissue damages. The graphical representation as showed in Fig. <a href="#Fig7">7</a> represents the effect of different mycotoxins at different interval of time. TeA covers maximum area of cell death from all interval of time from day 1 (30.0%) to day 6 (96.36%) followed by AOH covering an area (25.45%) on day 1 to (89.44%) day 6 and least toxic effect was imposed by AME having percentage coverage area (4.84%) on day 1 to (65.45%) day 6. Therefore, it can be easily interpreted that the potential of TeA among different toxins secreted by <i>Alternaria</i> is higher in developing necrotic spots hence cell death. </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"> <a href="http://doi.org/"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Figure 7</span> </a> </div>   <p>Comparision of toxic potency of TeA, AOH and AME on leaves of tomato plants.

Discussion</div> <p> <i>Alternaria</i> species are known as major plant pathogens and belongs to a diverse and ubiquitous group of fungi. In the present study, remarkable differences in morphological characteristics have been found such as colony morphology, conidial septation pattern and, shape and size of conidia among the different isolates of <i>Alternaria</i> collected from different regions in India. These morphological variations may be caused by alteration in temperature and their geographical regions <sup> <a href="#CR40">40</a>, <a href="#CR41">41</a> </sup>. The fungal pathogens were isolated from ideal environmental conditions including moist weather conditions with temperature ranging between 6–26 °C and soil pH 3–6.5. As the most favourable condition supporting the growth of <i>Alternaria</i> includes an optimal temperature ranging from 25–32 °C and at pH 4–5 <sup> <a href="#CR42">42</a>, <a href="#CR43">43</a> </sup>. The present studies investigated the efficiency of different isolates of <i>Alternaria</i> species and their differential potential to infect different hosts in terms of affected leaf area. The maximum pathogenicity was observed in tomato plants in comparison to other host plants. However, quality and quantity of different mycotoxins are the key factor for the detection of pathogenicity among different isolates. </p> <p>During their active growth and reproduction a wide array of toxic metabolites, including mycotoxins bearing different groups and complexity like dibenzopyrones, tetramic acids, lactones, quinones and cyclic peptides have been identified in <i>Alternaria</i> species <sup> <a href="#CR3">3</a>, <a href="#CR25">25</a>, <a href="#CR44">44</a> </sup>. It has been reported that besides these secondary metabolites some other chemical entities can be used for species identification <sup> <a href="#CR45">45</a>, <a href="#CR46">46</a> </sup>. Of these various metabolites mycotoxins are of particular importance causing acute toxicity by damaging cell components of actively growing cells during the course of symptom development in their hosts <sup> <a href="#CR47">47</a>, <a href="#CR48">48</a> </sup>. It has been demonstrated through several studies the reliability of these fungal metabolites in metabolic profiling for remarking differences and characterizing different pathogenic groups. The implication of these metabolites and characterizing these isolates through several analytical techniques like HPLC, MALDI-TOF MS and TLC has been experimentally reported <sup> <a href="#CR49">49</a>– <a href="#CR51">51</a> </sup>. Out of several mycotoxins reported from <i>Alternaria</i> the characterization of two potent toxins, AOH and AME have been evaluated on the basis of their retention factor values in presence of different solvents using TLC <sup> <a href="#CR52">52</a> </sup>. We have demonstrated and confirmed the presence of three mycotoxins including TeA, AOH and AME through TLC (based on R <sub>f</sub> values) and HPLC (based on retention time). Additionally the HPLC studies assist in quantitative determination of these metabolites using standard, available for these mycotoxins. The results showed the presence of higher dosages of these mycotoxins in 13 isolates out of total 48 isolates studied and have maximum pathogenic (60–100%) potential when compared to those isolates having moderate (30–60%) or low pathogenic (10–30%) (Table <a href="#Tab1">1</a>). </p> <p>TeA was isolated from <i>Alternaria longiceps</i>, <i>Alternaria kikuchiana</i>, <i>Alternaria mali</i> and <i>Pyricularia oryzae</i> as a phytotoxin and from <i>Alternaria</i> <i>alternata</i>, <i>Alternaria tenuissima</i> and <i>Phoma</i> sorghina as a mycotoxin <sup> <a href="#CR22">22</a>, <a href="#CR28">28</a>, <a href="#CR44">44</a> </sup>. Several studies demonstrated that various isolates of <i>Alternaria</i> species were detected TeA and reported its wide-spread occurrence <sup> <a href="#CR46">46</a>, <a href="#CR51">51</a>, <a href="#CR53">53</a> </sup>. Thus, it was thought to be a characteristic metabolite of this genus and not a pathogen-specific toxin. Several other workers also observed the production of TeA from <i>Alternaria</i> species isolated from different host plants <sup> <a href="#CR6">6</a> </sup>. It is considered to be having highest toxicity amongst the mycotoxins produced by <i>Alternaria</i> <sup> <a href="#CR31">31</a>, <a href="#CR54">54</a> </sup>. Our results also revealed that out of 48 strains of <i>Alternaria</i> species isolated from different vegetables, crops, and weed plants and 36 isolates produced TeA in maximum amount (Table <a href="#Tab4">4</a>), other than AOH and AME, which are host specific toxins. EFSA <sup> <a href="#CR55">55</a> </sup> has also reported that TeA has highest contamination frequency in tomato products. AOH, AME are cytotoxic and show synergetic effects <sup> <a href="#CR23">23</a> </sup>. <i>A. alternata</i> toxins influenced carrot seed germination negatively and TeA processes negative effect on carrot seed germination <sup> <a href="#CR56">56</a> </sup>. </p> <p>We have also demonstrated the level of pathogenicity of different isolates recovered from different plant samples and their efficiency for mycotoxin production in tomato plant. The result indicates the level of three different mycotoxins and their concentration represented in µg/ml, produced during their active growth. The statistical investigation also reveals the effect of <i>Alternaria</i> mycotoxins and their susceptibility on the host plant. The most drastic effect of pathogenicity of fungal genus has been found to be maximum in tomato as the potential concentration of all mycotoxins. It has been found that maximum isolates recovered from different tomato plants showed different toxic levels of all the mycotoxins when compared to their different hosts. The isolate TM 4 showed maximum effective concentration for all the three mycotoxins viz., TeA, AOH and AME. The other isolates recovered from different host have low level for all the mycotoxins. The study clearly demarcates the mycotoxic effect of <i>Alternaria</i> over tomato leaves and their potential for causing disease. The difference and variation found for different mycotoxins is due to defense mechanism responded by plants or to some extent their resistance against the pathogen and disease. </p> </div> <div class="conclusion" title="conclusion"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Conclusion</div> <p>The present study reports the molecular characterization, pathogenicity and toxigenicity of <i>Alternaria alternata</i> isolates from different regions of India and their relationship with other formae specilaes within the species of <i>Alternaria</i>. This study concludes that the fungal genus <i>Alternaria</i> encompasses severe pathogenic species causing diseases to various economically important horticultural crops and vegetables in Indian subcontinent. The study demonstrates the more prevalent pathogenic effect of <i>Alternaria</i> isolates over tomato when compared to other host plants and directly correlates the specificity of the pathogen for its host with regard to infection and disease development. The study also indicates that analyzing the genetic variability among <i>Alternaria</i> strains would be of great importance in plant breeding for disease resistance and can be used by plant breeders. The present study confirms that the more pathogenic isolates of <i>Alternaria</i> TM 4 (isolated from tomato leaf) secretes maximum amount of mycotoxins as compared to other isolates, which deteriorates the host plant and reduces the quality and significance of tomato plants. The isolated mycotoxins including TeA, AOH and AME from infected plants explain the role of these mycotoxins in producing necrosis in plants and appearance of diseased condition. However more research is needed to be done in this field to determine the effect of these toxins on animal model for future developments and well-being. </p> </div> <div class="materials_methods" title="materials|methods"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Instrumentation and equipment</div> <p>The method development was carried out using an Ascentis Express C-18 (2.1 × 100 mm, 2.7 μm) UPLC LG 500 nm system (Accucore RP-MS 100 × 3.0 MM, 2.6UM, ACQ-TQD-QBB1152, Waters acuity PDA detector, Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA) coupled to a MassLynx triple quadrupole MS detector (Waters, Milford, MA, USA). Data acquisition and evaluation were performed with MassLynx version 4.0. The final method was also transferred to a Thermo ACQ-TQD Quantum Ultra LC-MS/MS system (Thermo Finnigan, San Jose, CA, USA) that involved a Waters acquity QSM binary pump (SN- L10QSM943A), a Waters acquity fin autosampler (SN-M10SDI443M), a column thermostat and a TQD Quantum Ultra triple quadrupole MS detector. Target column temperature and target sample temperature were 30 °C and 10 °C, respectively. Data acquisition and evaluation were performed using Xcalibur software 2.0.7. SP1. Both systems were equipped with an electrospray interface (ESI) in which negative ionisation alone was used during acquisition. Nitrogen was used as drying and collision gas. The ion source parameters are summarised in Supplementary Table <a href="#MOESM1">S2</a>. Further, the method transferability was investigated with an LC-MS/MS system that consisted of an Agilent 1100 HPLC coupled to an AB Sciex 4000 triple quadrupole MS (Framingham, MA, USA). </p> </div> <div class="instrumentconditions" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Instrument conditions</div> <p>The <i>Alternaria</i> toxins are separated on an Ascentis Express C-18 (2.1 × 100 mm, 2.7 μm) UPLC column equipped with a 2.1 mm C-18 pre-column using linear gradient elution. Four solvents (solvents A, B, C and D) were mixed by the binary pump. The solvent A contained; acetonitrile (ACN) + water (5:95), solvent B contained; ACN: 5% isopropyl alcohol (IPA), solvent C contained; 100% methanol and solvent D contained; pure ammonium acetate. The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min. The mobile phase of the solvents in initial time was 0.0% A, 30% B, 30% C and 40% D. At the final time (5 min) the solvents were 0.0% A, 30% B, 30% C and 40% D. A sufficient washing step in the gradient programme was necessary to remove the accumulated lipophilic matrix solutes. The total analysis time was 5 min. The column thermostat maintained the temperature at 30 °C with the injection volume was 1.0 μl. The autosampler was operated at 20 °C. </p> <p>The UPLC LG 500 nm system was coupled to a MS/MS detector (Micromass Quattro Ultima PT) via an electrospray interface ﻿(ESI) that operates in negative mode. The optimized ESI settings were as follows: source temperature 120 °C, desolvation temperature 350 °C, drying gas flow 650 L/Hr, cone gas flow 30 L/Hr and capillary voltage 3.50 kV. Nitrogen is used as drying and collision gas (2.67 × 10 <sup>−6</sup> bar). Multiply monitoring reaction (MRM) mode was applied in the MS during the detection and two ion transitions were scanned for each target toxin. The MRM mode was applied in the MS/MS detector and two ion transitions (quantifier and qualifier) were recorded for each target compound. The selected ion transitions with the optimised voltages (cone or tube lens), collision energies (CE) and dwell times are summarised in table (Supplementary Table <a href="#MOESM1">S2</a>). </p> </div> <div class="assessmentoftoxicologicalpotentialofdifferentalternariamycotoxins(tea,aohandame)" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Assessment of toxicological potential of different <i>Alternaria</i> mycotoxins (TeA, AOH and AME) </div> <p>Measurement of extent of cell death as induced by different mycotoxins were determined by detached leaf inoculation method. For this, fresh leaf samples were detached from the green house grown plants and properly washed for 3–4 min in running tap water, sterilized in 1.0% (0.01 g/ml) sodium hypochlorite for about 1 min and then surface wiping of 70% ethanol, and finally aseptically rinsed thoroughly with sterile distilled water. Finally, the leaves were placed on moistened filter paper and punctured by a sterile needle on the lower surface. The toxins were dissolved in sterile deionized water at concentration of 100 μg/ml. Droplets (100 µl) of each of the three toxins were injected to the wounded leaves with a fine needle (Dispovan, 1 ml). A control sample was adjusted by injecting sterile distilled water. The treated leaf samples were maintained inside moist chamber (27 ± 0.5 °C temp. and 60% relative humidity) under green house conditions (14 h light and 10 h dark cycle at 27 °C). A regular observation (every 24 h for 6 days) was made in order to find out any changes relevant to toxicological effects as developed in injected samples with respect to control samples. The experimental set up was maintained in three replicates and the percentage affected leaf area due to toxic induced cell death were measured by (Systronic leaf area meter 211) and calculated by the formula as given below. </p><div class="disp-formula" title="disp-formula"> <div class="alternatives" title="alternatives"> <div class="tex" title="tex"> <div class="tex-math_UNKNOWN" id="M1">
