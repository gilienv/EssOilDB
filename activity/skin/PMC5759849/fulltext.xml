Linoleic acid (LA), the most abundant fatty acid in the epidermis, and its derivatives have an essential role in the structure and function of the epidermal barrier, and their defects are prominent in AD. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of two cosmetic products containing either LA or urea in patients with AD.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and methods</title><p>A total of 20 patients with AD who met the eligibility criteria and provided written informed consents were enrolled in this randomized, intra-individual split-body, single-center trial. Symmetrical lesions of patients were randomized for treatment with LA- or urea-containing water-in-oil (w/o) emulsions applied two to three times daily for 4 weeks. The efficacy of the two products was evaluated by local Scoring Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) of both lesions and also patient (or guardian) satisfaction. In addition, trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL), stratum corneum (SC) hydration, pH, sebum, temperature, erythema, melanin content, and ultrasonographic thickness and echo density of epidermis and dermis were measured before, and 2 and 4 weeks after, treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Four weeks of treatment with the LA-containing product resulted in a significant decrease in local SCORAD, TEWL, erythema, and echo density of dermis, as well as an increase in SC hydration compared to baseline. The urea-containing product also reduced the local SCO-RAD and echo density of dermis and increased SC hydration. In contrast to the LA-containing product, changes in TEWL and erythema were not significant. Moreover, the reduction of erythema was significantly higher in the LA-containing product-treated side compared to the urea-containing product-treated side (<italic>p</italic> = 0.006).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Both LA- or urea-containing w/o emulsions can significantly improve barrier dysfunction and clinical severity of AD. In agreement with literature, it was confirmed that an LA-containing w/o emulsion exhibited erythema-reducing effects. Since emollients should be used on a regular basis, patients should choose a product by individual preference following recommendation by their dermatologists.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>emollient</kwd><kwd>moisturizer</kwd><kwd>humectants</kwd><kwd>epidermal barrier</kwd><kwd>erythema</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory pruritic skin disorder characterized by increased trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL) which requires appropriate skin care on a regular basis.<xref rid="b1-ccid-11-021" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b3-ccid-11-021" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>The first line of skin protection against the environmental hazardous effects, water loss, and conservation of electrolyte balance is the epidermal barrier (EB).

One of the products contained 1.5% LA as cosmetic active ingredient, whereas the other one contained 5% urea. After 4 weeks of treatment, both products significantly decreased local SCORAD and significantly increased SC hydration, although reduction in skin erythema and TEWL was only significant in the lesions treated with the LA-containing product. An impaired skin barrier function and clinical signs of dryness are usually expected to be improved after use of the appropriate topical emulsion. Unfortunately, clinical improvement in xerosis and eczematous lesions may not necessarily induce normalization of TEWL.<xref rid="b26-ccid-11-021" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p><p>The beneficial effects of the two products, both w/o emulsions (appropriate pharmaceutical formulation for xerosis), can be explained by the measured increase in skin hydration and through possible effects on the barrier function, although only for the LA-containing product, a statistically significant change was observed for the TEWL. Components of the LA-containing product, such as complex mixture of esters, diesters and hydroxy esters of high molecular weight, lanolin alcohols, and lanolin acids, form an inert layer on the skin and can also penetrate the damaged skin and repair the EB leading to a reduction in TEWL.<xref rid="b27-ccid-11-021" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b31-ccid-11-021" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Thus, occlusion is the most predictable mechanism by which water loss is reduced from the skin.<xref rid="b32-ccid-11-021" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> However, since the two products tested in this clinical study are not identical in their composition, they exhibit different effects on the skin (as shown).</p><p>Moreover, different effects of products used for the treatment of xerosis in AD patients are well described in the literature.<xref rid="b12-ccid-11-021" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b33-ccid-11-021" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b35-ccid-11-021" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Patients with similar disease characteristics have been considered to benefit from different topically applied emulsions with different ingredients.<xref rid="b36-ccid-11-021" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Unfortunately, up to now, there is no unifying clinical classification system available to decide which type of products are best suited for different degrees of xerosis due to different AD phenotypes.<xref rid="b36-ccid-11-021" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Humectants such as urea in emulsions are absorbed into the SC and can increase skin hydration by attracting water. Although, in our study, the TEWL following application of urea-containing product decreased from baseline, the difference was not statistically significant, whereas skin hydration increased, which can be explained by the same mechanism mentioned earlier.</p><p>Essential fatty acids (EFAs) such as LA are necessary for the synthesis of ceramides, e.g., CER[EOH], CER[EOS] and CER[EOP], which play a critical role in barrier function of the epidermis.<xref rid="b14-ccid-11-021" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b15-ccid-11-021" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> In contrast to the urea-containing product, the LA-containing product significantly decreased erythema (one of the signs of inflammation) in this clinical study. According to the experimental literature, this is not surprising knowing that LA has anti-inflammatory effects.<xref rid="b17-ccid-11-021" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="b18-ccid-11-021" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="b37-ccid-11-021" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Since LA is a potent naturally occurring ligand and activator of PPRA&#x003b1;,<xref rid="b38-ccid-11-021" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> skin inflammation of irritant contact dermatitis is reduced by the topical application of LA in a mice model.<xref rid="b39-ccid-11-021" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> Moreover, an erythema-reducing effect was already reported in a previous clinical study in an irritative contact dermatitis model using a different LA-containing product. The effect of LA-containing product in that study was comparable to a 0.25% hydrocortisone-containing formulation.<xref rid="b40-ccid-11-021" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></p><p>Although skin pigmentation was not in the focus of our study, a clear trend toward a reduction in the melanin content in the LA-containing product-treated side was observed. This effect of the LA-containing product on melanin content may be explained via the abovementioned anti-inflammatory properties of LA leading to a reduction in post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation.<xref rid="b41-ccid-11-021" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> Of course, anti-pigmentary effect of other components in the LA-containing product cannot be ruled out.</p><p>Furthermore, unsaturated fatty acids such as oleic acid and LA can decrease tyrosinase activity (via posttranscriptional events and acceleration of the proteolysis of tyrosinase) and thus subsequently reduce melanin synthesis.<xref rid="b42-ccid-11-021" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></p><p>In this study, we also used high-frequency ultrasonography to assess dermal changes after treatment with the w/o emulsions. Both creams decreased dermal echo density significantly, which might be the result of a decrease in inflammation in the dermis. In contrast to another study that compared the results of ultrasound images with pathologic findings in AD, the echogenicity of dermis had a strong negative correlation with the intensity of inflammation.<xref rid="b43-ccid-11-021" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></p><p>It is worth to mention that, in this study, patients were more satisfied using the LA-containing w/o emulsion compared to the urea-containing product. This may be explained by the stinging and burning sensation of urea immediately after its application, which has been reported in previous studies.<xref rid="b14-ccid-11-021" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b44-ccid-11-021" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></p><p>Finally, we are aware of limitations of our study. First, this study was a small pilot study and exploratory in nature with low number of patients (n = 20). Second, we used split-body design to compare two products. Third, although we focused on urea and LA, we cannot and are not excluding the effect of whole product on seen clinical improvements. On the other hand, strengths of this study are direct comparison of products with objective as well as subjective assessment of efficacy.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Both products, the LA- and the urea-containing w/o emulsion, increased skin hydration and thus improved the clinical severity of AD in this clinical study. However, only the LA-containing product due to the known anti-inflammatory effects of LA reduced erythema significantly after treatment. In general, the choice of moisturizers can be determined by individual preference, safety, and efficacy, and the absence of fragrances, additives, or other sensitizing agents.<xref rid="b45-ccid-11-021" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1-ccid-11-021"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Patient questionnaire.</p></caption><media mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tif" xlink:href="ccid-11-021s1.tif" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e466" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was supported by research grant from Sina Tejarat Pishgam Co., Tehran, Iran.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>Christoph Abels, MD, PhD, a board-certified dermatologist, is an employee of Dr. August Wolff GmbH &#x00026; Co.
