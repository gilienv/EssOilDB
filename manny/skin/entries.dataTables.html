There are about two million visits to physicians per year for teenagers and the direct cost of acne treatment in the US exceeds $1 billion per year.A wide variety of treatment regimens exist for acne vulgaris including benzoil peroxide, retinoids, isotretinoids, keratolytic soaps, alpha hydroxy acids, azelaic acid, salicilic acid as well as hormonal, anti-androgen or antiseborrheic treatments. However, none of these methods is free of side effects and their exact role in therapy is not clear. In this paper apart from presenting the possible causes of acne vulgaris and its available drugs, recently published papers about medicinal plants used in the treatment of acne vulgaris were reviewed.Consumption of alternative and complementary medicine, including medicinal plants, is increasing and is common amongst patients affected by acne and infectious skin diseases. Medicinal plants have a long history of use and have been shown to possess low side effects. These plants are a reliable source for preparation of new drugs.Many plants seem to have inhibitory effects on the growth of bacteria, fungi and viruses in vitro. However, there are a few clinical evidences about the effectiveness and safety of these plants in the treatment of acne and other skin infections.">

We present a case of fatal menthol intoxication in a worker, who accidently got exposed when he was working in a peppermint factory. Emergency physicians must keep in mind this extremely rare manifestation of menthol poisoning. All necessary precaution should be taken to reduce its intake or exposure, as it has no specific antidote.

The present study was undertaken to explore the chemical compositions of the fruit essential oil of L. cubeba (LCEO) and the immunomodulatory effect of LCEO on dendritic cells and mice. The LCEO was analyzed using gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) with direct injection (DI/GC) or headspace-solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME/GC). In total, 56 components were identified, of which 48 were detected by DI/GC and 49 were detected by HS-SPME/GC. The principal compounds were citral (neral and geranial). An immunosuppressive activity of LCEO was investigated with bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DCs) which have a critical role to trigger the adaptive immunity. Additionally, the inhibitory effect of LCEO on immune response was elucidated by performing the contact hypersensitivity (CHS) responses in mice. Our results clearly showed that LCEO decreases the production of TNF-α and cytokine IL-12 in a dose-dependent manner in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated DCs. CHS response and the infiltrative T cells were inhibited in the tested ears of the mice co-treated with LCEO. We demonstrate, for the first time, that the LCEO mainly containing citral exhibits an immunosuppressive effect on DCs and mice, indicating that LCEO can potentially be applied in the treatment of CHS, inflammatory diseases, and autoimmune diseases.">

        <span class="abst" title="Acne is a common skin condition with sebum overproduction, hyperkeratosis, Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) and Staphylococcus aureus, and inflammation. Punica granatum (pomegranate) is well-known for its anti-inflammatory effects; however, few studies have discussed the anti-acne effects of pomegranate. In this study, we found that pomegranate extract (PG-E) significantly reduced P. acnes-induced edema in Wistar rat ears. Therefore, an evaluation platform using multiple pathogenic mechanisms of acne was established to explore the anti-acne effects of pomegranate. Results showed that PG-E inhibited bacterial growth and lipase activity. Through a bioguided-fractionation-isolation system, four hydrolysable tannins, punicalagin (1), punicalin (2), strictinin A (3), and granatin B (4), were isolated. Compounds 1 and 2 had greater anti-bacterial activities and anti-testosterone-induced HaCaT proliferative effects than the others. Compounds 1, 3, and 4 displayed lipase inhibitory effects. Compound 4 decreased cyclooxygenase-2 expression and downregulated prostaglandin E₂ production in heat-killed P. acnes-treated RAW 246.7 cells. In conclusion, PG-E is abundant in hydrolysable tannins that display multiple anti-acne capacities, including anti-bacterial, anti-lipase, anti-keratinocyte proliferation, and anti-inflammatory actions. Hence, PG-E has great potential in the application of anti-acne and skin-care products, and punicalagin (1), the most effective component in PG-E, can be employed as a quality control marker.">

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to develop and subsequently analyze the antimicrobial activity of a new multi-agent, synergic formulation based on plant-derived antimicrobial compounds (i.e., eugenol, β-pinene, eucalyptol, and limonene) and anti-inflammatory agents for potential use in the topical treatment of acne and other skin infections. The optimal antimicrobial combinations selected in this study were eugenol/β-pinene/salicylic acid and eugenol/β-pinene/2-phenoxyethanol/potassium sorbate. The possible mechanisms of action revealed by flow cytometry were cellular permeabilization and inhibition of efflux pumps activity induced by concentrations corresponding to sub-minimal inhibitory (sub-MIC) values. The most active antimicrobial combination represented by salycilic acid/eugenol/β-pinene/2-phenoxyethanol/potassium sorbate was included in a cream base, which demonstrated thermodynamic stability and optimum microbiological characteristics.">

Traditionally, terpene-containing plant oil has been used to treat various diseases without knowing the exact functions or the mechanisms of action of the individual bioactive compounds. This review categorizes various terpenes easily obtained from forests according to their anti-inflammatory, anti-tumorigenic, or neuroprotective activities. Moreover, potential action mechanisms of the individual terpenes and their effects on such processes, which are described in various in vivo and in vitro systems, are discussed. In conclusion, the studies that show the biological effectiveness of terpenes support the benefits of forest bathing and propose a potential use of terpenes as chemotherapeutic agents for treating various human diseases.">

Understanding the differences in the basic science of skin and hair is imperative in addressing their unique needs. Despite the paucity of conclusive data on racial and ethnic differences in skin of color, certain biologic differences do exist, which affect the disease presentations of several cutaneous disorders in pigmented skin. While the overall pathogenesis and treatments for acne in women of color are similar to Caucasian men and women, individuals with darker skin types present more frequently with dyschromias from acne, which can be difficult to manage. Melasma is an acquired pigmentary disorder seen commonly in women with darker skin types and is strongly associated with ultraviolet (UV) radiation, genetic factors, and hormonal influences. Lastly, certain hair care practices and hairstyles are unique among women of African descent, which may contribute to specific types of hair loss seen in this population, such as traction alopecia, trichorrhexis nodosa and central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia (CCCA).">

Combined with their popular use in dermatology, their availability, and the development of antimicrobial resistance, commercial essential oils are often an option for therapy. At least 90 essential oils can be identified as being recommended for dermatological use, with at least 1500 combinations. This review explores the fundamental knowledge available on the antimicrobial properties against pathogens responsible for dermatological infections and compares the scientific evidence to what is recommended for use in common layman's literature. Also included is a review of combinations with other essential oils and antimicrobials. The minimum inhibitory concentration dilution method is the preferred means of determining antimicrobial activity. While dermatological skin pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus have been well studied, other pathogens such as Streptococcus pyogenes, Propionibacterium acnes, Haemophilus influenzae, and Brevibacterium species have been sorely neglected. Combination studies incorporating oil blends, as well as interactions with conventional antimicrobials, have shown that mostly synergy is reported. Very few viral studies of relevance to the skin have been made. Encouragement is made for further research into essential oil combinations with other essential oils, antimicrobials, and carrier oils.">

        <span class="abst" title="Vegetable oils are obtained by mechanical extraction or cold pressing of various parts of plants, most often: seeds, fruits, and drupels. Chemically, these oils are compounds of the ester-linked glycerol and higher fatty acids with long aliphatic chain hydrocarbons (min. C14:0). Vegetable oils have a variety of properties, depending on their percentage of saturation. This article describes sea-buckthorn oil, which is extracted from the well characterized fruit and seeds of sea buckthorn. The plant has a large number of active ingredients the properties of which are successfully used in the cosmetic industry and in medicine. Valuable substances contained in sea-buckthorn oil play an important role in the proper functioning of the human body and give skin a beautiful and healthy appearance. A balanced composition of fatty acids give the number of vitamins or their range in this oil and explains its frequent use in cosmetic products for the care of dry, flaky or rapidly aging skin. Moreover, its unique unsaturated fatty acids, such as palmitooleic acid (omega-7) and gamma-linolenic acid (omega-6), give sea-buckthorn oil skin regeneration and repair properties. Sea-buckthorn oil also improves blood circulation, facilitates oxygenation of the skin, removes excess toxins from the body and easily penetrates through the epidermis. Because inside the skin the gamma-linolenic acid is converted to prostaglandins, sea-buckthorn oil protects against infections, prevents allergies, eliminates inflammation and inhibits the aging process. With close to 200 properties, sea-buckthorn oil is a valuable addition to health and beauty products.">

The present study was conducted to investigate antibacterial activity of ethanolic extract of cinnamon bark, honey, and their combination against acne bacteria. The antibacterial activity of extract of cinnamon bark and honey were investigated against P. acnes and S. epidermidis using disc diffusion. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were attained using Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI) methods. The interaction between cinnamon bark extract and honey was determined using a checkerboards method. The results showed that the MICs of cinnamon bark extract and honey against P. acne were 256 µg/mL and 50% v/v, respectively, while those against S. epidermidis were 1024 µg/mL and 50% v/v, respectively. The MBC of cinnamon bark extract against P. acnes and S. epidermidis were more than 2048 µg/mL, whereas the MBC for honey against P. acnes and S. epidermidis were 100%. The combination of cinnamon bark extract and honey against P. acnes and S. epidermidis showed additive activity with a fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) value of 0.625. Therefore, the combination of cinnamon bark extract and honey has potential activity against acne-causing bacteria.">

The present study was conducted to investigate synergistic effect of Carum copticum and Mentha piperita essential oils with ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, and gentamicin on Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.In this experimental study, the synergistic effects of C. copticum and M. piperita essential oils with antibiotics on Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212), Escherichia coli (ATCC 8739), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 9027), Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 14990), and Listeria monocytogenes (ATCC 7644) were studied according to broth microdilution and the MIC and fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) of these two essential oils determined.C. copticum essential oil at 30 μg/ml could inhibit S. aureus, and in combination with vancomycin, decreased MIC from 0.5 to 0.12 μg/ml. Moreover, the FIC was derived 0.24 μg/ml which represents a potent synergistic effect with vancomycin against S. aureus growth. C. copticum essential oil alone or combined with other antibiotics is effective in treating bacterial infections.In addition, C. copticum essential oil can strengthen the activities of certain antibiotics, which makes it possible to use this essential oil, especially in drug resistance or to lower dosage or toxicity of the drugs.">

However, with the constant and rapid changes of personal tastes, this appeal could vanish and this sector could decline quite quickly. New dissemination paths need to be found to tap this valuable resource. Methods: In this way, its potential use in cosmetics either as an active ingredient per se (with cosmeceutical significance or presenting antimicrobial activity) has hence been explored in vitro. Results: In this contribution, we demonstrated that vetiver essential oil displays no particularly significant and innovative cosmetic potential value in formulations apart from its scent already largely exploited. However, evaluated against twenty bacterial strains and two Candida species using the in vitro microbroth dilution method, vetiver oil demonstrated notably some outstanding activities against Gram-positive strains and against one Candida glabrata strain. Conclusions: Based on these findings, vetiver essential oil appears to be an appropriate aspirant for the development of an antimicrobial agent for medicinal purposes and for the development of a cosmetic ingredient used for its scent and displaying antimicrobial activity as an added value.">

It used to treat sore throat, fever, indigestion, and pains.The objective of this study is to establish the chemical composition of the essential oil of flower, leaves of F. tingitana, and to throw light on antimicrobial, cytotoxic activities of Libyan plant.The chemical composition of the essential oil of flower (0.06% w/v) and leaves (0.1% w/v) of F. tingitana was comparatively analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry using nonpolar column DB-5.A total of 28-32 components were identified, 15 being common in both samples. The main constituents of both flower- and leave-derived oil samples were α-thujene (13.5%-2.3%), elemol (8.9%-8.3%), eudesmol (0.6%-9.7%) and cadinol (2.2%-13.8%), respectively. The principle difference was a considerably more pronounced sesquiterpenes presence in the leaves-oil, amounting to 74.0%, than in the flower counterpart (39.9%). Caryophyllene (5.6%) and elemol (8.9%) were the major sesquiterpenes detected in flower-oil while leaves-oil showed less amounts of sesquiterpenoid hydrocarbons (27.7%) and represented by eudesmadiene (9.0%). On the contrary, while remaining the dominant group in both oil samples, monoterpenoids are relatively more abundant in flower-derived oil constituting 57.7% versus 24.5% detected in leaves.Leaves-oil sample being mostly efficient as antibacterial against Bacillus subtilis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae with potency 48.3, 41.9% compared to tetracycline standard antibacterial drug. The essential oil samples revealed marked in vitro cytotoxicity against breast (MCF7), cervical (HELA) and liver(HEPG2) carcinoma cell lines with IC50% (6.9, 4.8), (8.6, 10.9), and (4.4, 4.2) for the flower-, leaves-derived oil sample, respectively.Comparative analysis of the investigated oil samples indicates more pronounced monoterpene contents in Ferula tingitana flower. The principle monoterpenoid constituents of both oils are α-thujene. Sesquiterpenes presence is considerably more pronounced in the leaves-derived oil sampleElemol, cadinol, α-thujene and a-terpinoline, the major components of the flower- and leaves-derived oil in the present work and were not detected in the Turkish sample. The differences may be due to climatic and other extrinsic conditions such as where and when the samples were collectedWhen screened for antimicrobial activity, the flower- and leaves-derived oil of F. tingitana exhibited a mild effect against all tested Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms. However, not displayed growth inhibitory effect against the fungus Aspergillus flavus and Candida albicansOn assessing the cytotoxic activity, the flower- and leaves-derived oil exhibited specific and significant effects on the viability of the selected human cell lines, viz., hormone-responsive breast carcinoma cell line (MCF7), cervical carcinoma cell line (HELA), and liver carcinoma cell line (HEPG2).

Results:The most concentrated fatty acids were palmitic acid (15.34%) &lt; oleic acid (22.31%) &lt; linoleic acid (50.56%) for the pulp oil while that of seed oil were oleic acid (12.34%) &lt; palmitic acid (25.37%) &lt; linoleic acid (38.87%). Arachidic, behenic, lignoceric and palmitoleic acids were all present in small quantities with none of them recording up to 1.0% in either of the samples. Lauric was determined but not detected in the pulp oil. The fatty acid composition of pulp and seed oils contained a healthy mixture of all the types of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. The value of polyunsaturated/saturated index (P/S) which is associated to the impact on human health was higher in the pulp oil (2.47). Phospatidylinositol had the highest content (17.69 mg/100g) in the pulp oil while the highest content in seed oil was phosphatidylcholine (351.82 mg/100g). The total phytosterols for pulp and seed oils were 17.09 and 436.37 mg/100g, respectively. The results of some physicochemical parameters of pulp and seed oils were colour (light amber yellow and pale yellow), kinematic viscosity (9.15 and 10.62 mm2/s), specific gravity (0.92 and 0.92), unsaponifiable matter (1.63 and 2.54%), flash point 29.00 and 295.00oC), saponification value (189.40 and 190.22 mg KOH/g), peroxide value (8.15 and 9.20 meq O2/kg), iodine value (94.24 and 122.42 mg of I/100 g) and acid value (16.50 and 24.00 mg KOH/g), respectively. Conclusion:Generally, high percentage PUFA and low value of cholesterol may make either of the sample oils, a good food source on health wise basis. It was also revealed that both sample oils may be developed into a commercial product for use in food products.">

Skin sites (glabella [GL], hand-back [HB], interdigital web-space [IS], antecubital fossa [AF], volar forearm [VF], back [BA]) were classified as normal, oily or dry based on two-step cluster analysis and exposed or unexposed (uncovered or covered by clothes, respectively) based on seasonal apparel. Pseudomonadaceae and Staphylococcus aureus had the highest and lowest detection rate respectively at all sites. Cluster analysis identified skin sites as 'normal' (HB, BA, AF, VF), 'dry' (IS) and 'oily' (GL). Bacterial alpha diversity was higher in exposed (HB, IS, and GL) compared with unexposed sites (BA, AF and VF). Co-occurrence of Staphylococcus aureus with any of the other five microorganisms was lower in dry and oily skin versus normal skin.

Such NLCs were prepared using different ratios of EO/solid lipid and those containing EO 3% w/w and cetyl pamitate 7% w/w were selected for in vivo studies, showing the best technological properties (small particle size, low polydispersity index and good stability). Gels containing free EO or EO-loaded NLCs were applied on the hand skin surface of ten healthy volunteers twice a day for one week. Skin hydration and elasticity changes were recorded using the instrument Soft Plus. Gels containing EO-loaded NLCs showed a significant increase in skin hydration in comparison with gels containing free EO. Skin elasticity increased, as well, although to a lesser extent. The results of this study point out the usefulness of rosemary EO-loaded NLCs for the treatment of cutaneous alterations involving loss of skin hydration and elasticity.">

The IC50 values were calculated in both the promastigote and amastigote stages in J774 macrophage in comparison with meglumine antimoniate (MA) as positive control. In addition, cytotoxicity effects of essential oils and nano-emulsions prepared from both plants against macrophages were evaluated.Both essential oil and nano-emulsion of Lavander and Rosemary showed anti-leishmania activity on promastigote with IC50=0.11 μl/mL, IC50=0.26 μl/mL, and IC50=0.08 μl/mL respectively. Moreover, during amastigote assay, Lavander and Rosemary essential oils and nano-emulsion were effective at least in concentration of 0.12 μl/mL and 0.06 μl/mL (P=0.0001) respectively, on mean infected macrophages (MIR) and amastigotes in macrophages (P=0.0001). Additionally, cytotoxicity assay against macrophage revealed no toxicity on the host cells at IC50 concentrations.The nano-emulsions of both plants were more effective than essential oil in both MIR and amastigote. However, in comparison with MA, the Lavander essential oil is more effective in reducing MIR. Rosemary nano-emulsion reduced MIR significantly more than MA in concentration of 0.25 μl/mL (P&lt;0.001). Further investigations are recommended to evaluate the effect of these medicinal plants in murine models.">

Linoleic acid (LA), the most abundant fatty acid in the epidermis, and its derivatives have an essential role in the structure and function of the epidermal barrier, and their defects are prominent in AD. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of two cosmetic products containing either LA or urea in patients with AD.A total of 20 patients with AD who met the eligibility criteria and provided written informed consents were enrolled in this randomized, intra-individual split-body, single-center trial. Symmetrical lesions of patients were randomized for treatment with LA- or urea-containing water-in-oil (w/o) emulsions applied two to three times daily for 4 weeks. The efficacy of the two products was evaluated by local Scoring Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) of both lesions and also patient (or guardian) satisfaction. In addition, trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL), stratum corneum (SC) hydration, pH, sebum, temperature, erythema, melanin content, and ultrasonographic thickness and echo density of epidermis and dermis were measured before, and 2 and 4 weeks after, treatment.Four weeks of treatment with the LA-containing product resulted in a significant decrease in local SCORAD, TEWL, erythema, and echo density of dermis, as well as an increase in SC hydration compared to baseline. The urea-containing product also reduced the local SCO-RAD and echo density of dermis and increased SC hydration. In contrast to the LA-containing product, changes in TEWL and erythema were not significant. Moreover, the reduction of erythema was significantly higher in the LA-containing product-treated side compared to the urea-containing product-treated side (p = 0.006).Both LA- or urea-containing w/o emulsions can significantly improve barrier dysfunction and clinical severity of AD. In agreement with literature, it was confirmed that an LA-containing w/o emulsion exhibited erythema-reducing effects. Since emollients should be used on a regular basis, patients should choose a product by individual preference following recommendation by their dermatologists.">

The murine model with immunologic phenomena resembling human AD was introduced, which demonstrated skewedness toward predominance of type-2 helper T cell reactivity and pathophysiological changes similar as human AD following 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) sensitization and challenge. Molecular mechanism on the DNCB-mediated AD was further evaluated. Skin tissues were collected from mice treated with DNCB, and each tissue was equally divided into two sections; one for protein and the other for mRNA analysis. Expression of filaggrin, an important protein for keratinocyte integrity, was evaluated through SDS-PAGE. Level of mRNA expression for cytokines was determined through semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Expression of filaggrin protein was significantly enhanced in the mice treated with DNCB compared with the vehicle (acetone : olive oil = 4 : 1 mixture) treatment group or the normal group without any treatment. Level of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-18 mRNA expression, cytokines involved in activity of type-1 helper T (TH1) cell, was significantly downregulated in the AD group compared with other control groups. These results suggest that suppression of TH1 cell-mediated immune response could be reflected into the skin tissue of mice treated with DNCB for AD induction, and disturbance of keratinocyte integrity might evoke a compensatory mechanism.">

Effectiveness of topical drug application is depended on different parameters such as skin barrier properties, physicochemical properties of drug and vehicle, and interaction between drug and its vehicle with the skin layers. In this review, an overview of skin structure and feature of polymeric micelles as topical nanocarriers is provided. We also summarized the research studies dealing with the application of polymeric micelles for cutaneous delivery. In the past decades, numerous types of nanocarriers have been widely investigated as a novel delivery approach to improve skin penetration and localization of drugs in normal skin and dermatological diseases. Polymeric micelles are one of them, with their specific ability to encapsulate hydrophilic drugs. These carriers can enhance the therapeutic efficacy and minimize the systemic side effects of the drugs. Polymeric micelles could enhance the deposition of drugs in targeted sites of the skin in the normal and dermatological diseases such as psoriasis and acne. Nevertheless, still there is a need to investigate the mechanism of action of these carriers and the fate of polymeric micelles in skin.">

However, as the need for these functions decreased along the evolutionary changes in humans, a relevant question has been raised: are sebaceous glands and sebum the remnants of our mammalian heritage or do they have overtaken a far more complex role in human skin biology? Trying to provide answers to this question, this review introduces the evolving field of sebaceous immunobiology and puts into the focus the pathways that sebum lipids use to influence the immune milieu of the skin. By introducing possible modifiers of sebaceous lipogenesis and discussing the - human-specific - alterations in composition and amount of sebum, the attribute of sebum as a sensitive tool, which is capable of translating multiple signalling pathways into the dermal micro environment is presented. Further their interaction with macrophages and keratinocytes involves sebum lipid fractions into disease pathogenesis, which could lead - on the other side - to the development of novel sebum-based therapeutic strategies.">

In this study, we investigated the effect of superoxide dismutase 3 (SOD3) on P. acnes- or peptidoglycan (PGN)-induced inflammation in vitro and in vivo. Our data demonstrated that SOD3 suppressed toll-like receptor-2 (TLR-2) expression in P. acnes- or PGN-treated keratinocytes and sebocytes. Moreover, we found that SOD3 suppressed the expressions of phosphorylated nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and p38 in P. acnes- or PGN-treated cells. SOD3 also exhibited an anti-inflammatory role by reducing the expression of inflammasome-related proteins (NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1) and inhibiting the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and interleukin-8. In addition, SOD3 reduced lipid accumulation and expression of lipogenic regulators in P. acnes-treated sebocytes. Recombinant SOD3-treated wild-type mice and SOD3 transgenic mice, which were subcutaneously infected with P. acnes, showed tolerance to inflammation through reducing inflammatory cell infiltration in skin, ear thickness, and expression of inflammatory mediators. Our result showed that SOD3 could suppress the inflammation through inhibition of TLR2/p38/NF-κB axis and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Therefore, SOD3 could be a promising candidate for treatment of P. acnes-mediated skin inflammation.">

One isoform, PDE4, is overactive in chronic relapsing inflammatory skin diseases: psoriasis and eczema/atopic dermatitis, and in several cancers. East Indian sandalwood oil (EISO) has significant anti-inflammatory properties. Here, we report that 75% of pediatric eczema/atopic dermatitis patients treated with topical EISO formulations achieved a &gt;50% reduction in their Eczema Area and Severity Index score. EISO treatment of a psoriasis model reduced PDE4 expression and reversed histopathology. EISO directly inhibited PDE enzymatic activity in vitro. In lipopolysaccharide-stimulated human dermal fibroblast, BEAS-2B, A549, and THP-1 cells, EISO suppressed total cellular PDE activity, PDE4, and 7 transcript levels, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) activation, and pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokine production. These results suggest that EISO anti-inflammatory activity is mediated through suppressing PDE activity, thus facilitating cAMP-regulated inhibition of NF-κB and indicate EISO as an attractive natural therapeutic for chronic and acute inflammatory disorders.">

We used intentional non-probability sampling and sequential selection, considering all notified occupational dermatoses.All cases of occupational dermatoses referred to in the period were analyzed (n = 4710). Males and the age group of 35-49 years were the most affected. The most affected body area was the upper limb (34.2%) and the hand (25.4%). The &quot;causative agent&quot; field in the forms was not filled in 69.4% of cases, with chrome as the most prevalent cause reported (11.8%). ICD-10 codes more prevalent were L23, L24, and L25, corresponding to 34.2% of the sample. In total, 29% of patients needed to take a sick leave. No cases evolved to death and there were 0.2% of total as permanent disability.The amount of missing information for various items in the system draws attention.Treatment of patients with occupational dermatitis include the identification and removal of the causative agent and specific treatment of the disease.

LEO was analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) methods and showed predominance of 1,8-cineole (39.83%), borneol (22.63%), and camphor (22.12%). LEO at concentrations of 0.5, 1, 3, and 10 μg/ml did not present in vitro cytotoxicity. Additionally, LEO did not stimulate the leukocyte chemotaxis in vitro. The LEO topical application at concentrations of 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mg/ear reduced edema formation, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, and nitric oxide (NO) production in croton oil-induced ear edema model. In carrageenan-induced paw edema model, LEO treatment at doses of 75, 100, and 250 mg/kg reduced edema formation, MPO activity, and NO production. In dextran-induced paw edema model, LEO at doses of 75 and 100 mg/kg reduced paw edema and MPO activity. In conclusion, LEO presented anti-inflammatory activity, and the mechanism proposed of LEO seems to be, at least in part, involving the participation of prostanoids, NO, proinflammatory cytokines, and histamine.">

In order to better cognize the preventive and therapeutic role of barley grass for chronic diseases, we carried out the systematic strategies for functional ingredients of barley grass, based on the comprehensive databases, especially the PubMed, Baidu, ISI Web of Science, and CNKI, between 2008 and 2017. Barley grass is rich in functional ingredients, such as gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), flavonoids, saponarin, lutonarin, superoxide dismutase (SOD), K, Ca, Se, tryptophan, chlorophyll, vitamins (A, B1, C, and E), dietary fiber, polysaccharide, alkaloid, metallothioneins, and polyphenols. Barley grass promotes sleep; has antidiabetic effect; regulates blood pressure; enhances immunity; protects liver; has anti-acne/detoxifying and antidepressant effects; improves gastrointestinal function; has anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, hypolipidemic, and antigout effects; reduces hyperuricemia; prevents hypoxia, cardiovascular diseases, fatigue, and constipation; alleviates atopic dermatitis; is a calcium supplement; improves cognition; and so on. These results support that barley grass may be one of the best functional foods for preventive chronic diseases and the best raw material of modern diet structure in promoting the development of large health industry and further reveal that GABA, flavonoids, SOD, K-Ca, vitamins, and tryptophan mechanism of barley grass have preventive and therapeutic role for chronic diseases. This paper can be used as a scientific evidence for developing functional foods and novel drugs for barley grass for preventive chronic diseases.">

IL-31 was reported to be increased in specimens from patients with atopic dermatitis, and IL-31-transgenic mice develop atopic dermatitis-like skin inflammation, which is involved in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis. However, the role of IL-31 in development of contact dermatitis/contact hypersensitivity (CHS), which is mediated by hapten-specific T cells, including Th2 cells, is not fully understood. Therefore, we investigated this using IL-31-deficient (Il31-/-) mice, which we newly generated. We demonstrated that the mice showed normal migration and maturation of skin dendritic cells and induction of hapten-specific T cells in the sensitization phase of FITC-induced CHS, and normal induction of local inflammation in the elicitation phase of FITC- and DNFB-induced CHS. On the other hand, those mice showed reduced scratching frequency and duration during FITC- and/or DNFB-induced CHS. Our findings suggest that IL-31 is responsible for pruritus, but not induction of local skin inflammation, during CHS induced by FITC and DNFB.">

Wound healing involves a series of biochemical and cellular events that are tightly controlled, divided into 3 concomitant and overlapping phases: inflammation, proliferation, and remodelling. Poor wound healing or a chronic wound represents a silent epidemic that affects billions of people worldwide. Considering the involvement of immune cells in its resolution, recent studies are focused on investigating the roles of immune nutrients such as amino acids, minerals, and fatty acids on wound healing. Among the fatty acids, much attention has been given to omega-6 (ω-6) fatty acids since they can modulate cell migration and proliferation, phagocytic capacity, and production of inflammatory mediators. The present review summarizes current knowledge about the role of ω-6 fatty acids in the wound healing context.">

Scanning electron microscopy revealed microstructural features similar to hardwoods. Confocal microscopy revealed three major layers in the cell wall: middle lamella, primary cell wall and secondary cell wall. Computed tomography improved the visualization of pore shape and pore connectivity in three dimensions. Mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) showed that the average accessible porosity was 76.67 ± 2.03% and pore size classes could be distinguished into micropores (3-10 nm) and macropores (0.1-1 µm and 20-80 µm). The absolute density was evaluated by helium pycnometry, MIP and Archimedes' methods. The results show that these methods can lead to misinterpretation of absolute density. The MIP method showed a realistic absolute density (1.45 g cm-3) consistent with the density of the known constituents, including lignin, cellulose and hemi-cellulose. However, helium pycnometry and Archimedes' methods gave falsely low values owing to 10% of the volume being inaccessible pores, which require sample pretreatment in order to be filled by liquid or gas. This indicates that the determination of the cell wall density is strongly dependent on sample geometry and preparation.">

Severity and response to treatment may be impacted by various external factors or exposome. AIM:To assess the impact of environmental factors on acne and to provide a comprehensive overview of the acne exposome. METHODS:Two consensus meetings of five European dermatologists and a comprehensive literature search on exposome factors triggering acne served as a basis for this review. RESULTS:Acne exposome was defined as the sum of all environmental factors influencing the occurrence, duration and severity of acne. Exposome factors impact on the response and the frequency of relapse to treatments by interacting with the skin barrier, sebaceous gland, innate immunity and cutaneous microbiota. They may be classified into the following six main categories: nutrition, psychological and lifestyle factors, occupational factors including cosmetics, as well as pollutants, medication and climatic factors. Moreover, practical considerations for the dermatologist's clinical practice are proposed. CONCLUSION:Exposome factors including nutrition, medication, occupational factors, pollutants, climatic factors, and psychosocial and lifestyle factors may impact on the course and severity of acne and on treatment efficacy. Identifying and reducing the impact of exposome is important for an adequate acne disease management.">

In a contact + fumigant bioassay, M. officinalis oil (France) was more active against D. farinae and D. pteronyssinus, compared to M. officinalis oils (Ireland and Serbia). Interestingly, color alteration of D. farinae and D. pteronyssinus was exhibited, changing from colorless to golden brown through the treatment with M. officinalis oils. The acaricidal and color alteration principle of three M. officinalis oils was determined to be 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal. M. officinalis oil (France) and 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal were significantly more effective in closed containers than in open containers, indicating that their acaricidal route of action was largely a result of vapor action. Sprays (0.5 and 1%) containing 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal and 1% spray containing M. officinalis oil (France) resulted in 100% mortality and color alteration against D. farinae and D. pteronyssinus.

Isotretinoin is recommended in the treatment of recalcitrant or severe acne, but it is associated with common adverse effects that frequently result in patients incompliance and discontinuation of the drug. The present study was designed to assess the efficacy of oral omega-3 in decreasing the adverse effects of isotretinoin. Materials and Methods. In this randomized double-blind clinical trial, a total of 118 patients with moderate or severe acne were randomly divided into two (case and control) groups. The control group was treated with isotretinoin 0.5 mg/kg, and the case group was treated with the same dose of isotretinoin combined with oral omega-3 (1 g/day). The treatment was lasted for 16 weeks and mucocutaneous side effects of isotretinoin were recorded and compared between the two groups in weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16. Results. Cheilitis (at weeks 4, 8, and 12), xerosis, dryness of nose at all weeks, and dryness of eyes (at week 4) were less frequent in the group that received isotretinoin combined with oral omega-3 compared to the group that received isotretinoin alone. Conclusion. Administration of oral omega-3 in acne patients who are receiving isotretinoin decreases the mucocutaneous side effects of isotretinoin.

Recently, we reported that fat-1 mice, which can convert n-6 to n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), are protected against allergic airway inflammation because their Th2 immune responses are suppressed. Here, we examined the effects of endogenously synthesized n-3 PUFAs on atopic dermatitis, a representative Th2-dominant allergic inflammatory disease. Mouse models of atopic dermatitis-like skin lesions were prepared by epicutaneous application of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) or house dust mite (HDM) extract to the ears. DNCB-treated fat-1 mice exhibited markedly reduced epidermal thickening, lower mast cell infiltration, and lower serum IgE and histamine compared with wild-type mice. The draining lymph nodes of fat-1 mice were substantially smaller and contained significantly smaller proportions of activated CD4+ T cells and IL-4-producing Th2 cells than those of wild-type mice. Consistent with these findings, the mRNA levels of Th2 cytokines were significantly decreased in DNCB-sensitized skin lesions of fat-1 mice. Lastly, inflammasome activation, IL-1β production, and pyroptotic cell injury were suppressed in fat-1 mice. Similar results were observed in HDM-challenged fat-1 mice. This study confirms the results of previous clinical studies and suggests fish oil supplementation as a therapeutic strategy for atopic dermatitis-like skin lesions.">

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of evening primrose oil (EPO) on fatigue and quality of life in patients with MS.In this double-blind randomized clinical trial, 52 patients with MS were chosen and categorized into 2 groups which received 2 doses of EPO and placebo. In addition, the quality of life and fatigue scale in these patients were investigated before the treatment and again 3 months after therapy. The findings were then compared between the 2 groups.EPO consumption significantly increased cognitive function, vitality, and overall life satisfaction and also reduced pain and fatigue compared to placebo (P&lt;0.05).Our findings indicated that EPO consumption had no impact on the quality of life in general; however, it had a significant effect on several important aspects of life quality such as the increase of cognitive function, vitality, and overall life satisfaction. It also reduced the pain and fatigue in comparison to the placebo consumption. Herbal medicines are brittle and have fewer side effects than chemical drugs. With use of this plant, reduced fatigue and improved quality of life were observed in MS patients. But the drug did not prevent the progression of the disease.">

ACD represents a common health issue and is also one of the most important occupational diseases. Although this inflammatory skin disease is mediated predominantly by memory T lymphocytes recognizing low-molecular-weight chemicals after skin contact, the innate immune system also plays an important role. Along that line, the presence of irritants may increase the risk of ACD and therefore ACD is often seen in the context of irritant contact dermatitis. In this review article, we discuss recent progress in basic research that has dramatically increased our understanding of the pathomechanisms of ACD and provides a basis for the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic measures.

Many major metabolites that have been reported to contain anti-allergic properties are terpene compounds which can be found in the essential oil extracted from the rhizomes of Z. zerumbet, such as zerumbone, limonene, and humulene. The rhizome is among the part of Z. zerumbet that has been widely used for many studies due to its exceptional biomedical applications. Most of these studies have shown that the essential oil, which can be obtained through hydro-distillation of the rhizomes from Z. zerumbet, is enriched with various active metabolites. Therefore, this mini-review provides an overview of the main aspects related to the anti-allergic and immunomodulatory properties of the major bioactive compounds found in the essential oils extracted from the rhizomes of Z. zerumbet, with the aim of demonstrating the importance of essential oil extracted from the rhizomes of Z. zerumbet and its bioactive compounds in the treatment of allergy and allergy-related diseases, in addition to other widely reported and extensively studied biomedical applications.">

Probiotics, phenolics, and vitamins are just a few of the nutraceuticals meant to potentially prevent and assist medical management of dermatologic conditions. Among these, probiotics, vitamin E, and green tea catechins may offer the broadest array of skin protective mechanisms with probiotics having the greatest clinical range. Probiotics&amp;rsquo; amelioration of atopic dermatitis and opportunistic infections of skin burns has been targeted in recent research efforts. This includes the improvement of Scoring Atopic Dermatitis index scores, p = 0.02, with intact Lactobacillus rhamnosus Goldin and Gorbach (LGG) in comparison to heat inactivated LGG or placebo. Lactobacillus reuteri used prior to or concurrently with Staphylococcus aureus infection can increase epidermal keratinocyte survival, p &lt; 0.01. Phenolics may not have been extensively studied for atopic dermatitis or skin burns. However, phenolics do have a role in photoprotection. The phenolic rutin increases ultraviolet B radiation filter reactive oxygen species scavenging at 75%, p &lt; 0.002, and peak wavelength absorption, p &lt; 0.001. While oral and topical probiotics have untapped potential for atopic dermatitis amelioration and skin infection prevention, phenolics will be increasingly used for photoprotection. With optimized bioavailability, dosage, and formulation, nutraceuticals will become crucial for healthy skin maintenance.">

Of 446 non-duplicate publications identified by above search, 147 were excluded based on scrutiny of title, abstract and key words. Of the remaining 299 examined in full text, 291 were deemed appropriate for inclusion, and main findings were summarised in topic sections. In conclusion, diverse sources of exposures to chemicals of widely-differing types and structures, continue to induce sensitisation in man and may result in allergic contact dermatitis. Many of the chemicals are &quot;evergreen&quot; but others are &quot;newcomers&quot;.

Evening primrose oil (EPO) as a source of GLA has been of interest in the management of AD.The aim of this randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of EPO in Korean patients with AD.Fifty mild AD patients with an Eczema Area Severity Index (EASI) score of 10 or less were enrolled and randomly divided into two groups. The first group received an oval unmarked capsule containing 450 mg of EPO (40 mg of GLA) per capsule, while placebo capsules identical in appearance and containing 450 mg of soybean oil were given to the other group. Treatment continued for a period of four months. EASI scores, transepidermal water loss (TEWL), and skin hydration were evaluated in all the AD patients at the baseline, and in months 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the study.At the end of month 4, the patients of the EPO group showed a significant improvement in the EASI score (p=0.040), whereas the patients of the placebo group did not. There was a significant difference in the EASI score between the EPO and placebo groups (p=0.010). Although not statistically significant, the TEWL and skin hydration also slightly improved in the EPO patients group.We suggest that EPO is a safe and effective medicine for Korean patients with mild AD.">

First, surfactants and co-surfactants were screened on their efficiency to form ME using pseudo-ternary phase diagrams. The influences of surfactant and co-surfactant mass ratios were studied and optimized ME-loaded-films were prepared. Then, films containing orange oil ME were characterized by SEM and texture analyzer, and then evaluated for antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Propionibacterium acnes using an agar disc diffusion method. The results showed that Tween 80 as surfactant and propylene glycol as co-surfactant at a 1:1 ratio possessed the maximum ME area. Three ME formulations of ME 20, ME 25, and ME 30, which consisted of 20, 25, and 30% w/v of orange oil were prepared, respectively. All ME formulations showed particle sizes of about 60.26⁻80.00 nm, with broad a polydispersity index of 0.42. The orange oil ME films exhibited higher elastic values than the control. The diameters of inhibition zones for FME 20, FME 25, and FME 30 against P. acnes were 13.64, 15.18, and 16.10 mm, respectively. Only the FME 30 had an antimicrobial activity against S. aureus with 8.32 mm of inhibition zone. Contrarily, the control film had no antimicrobial activity against both bacteria. In conclusion, the present study found that the antibacterial activity of orange oil in pectin thin film could be enhanced by preparing orange oil as an ME before loading into pectin thin film.">

        <span class="abst" title="Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common inflammatory skin disease characterized by a complex, heterogeneous pathogenesis including skin barrier dysfunction, immunology, and pruritus. Although epidermal growth factor (EGF) is essential for epithelial homeostasis and wound healing, the effect of EGF on AD remains to be explored. To develop a new therapy for AD, the anti-AD potential of EGF was investigated by inducing AD-like skin lesions in NC/Nga mice using 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB). EGF was administrated to NC/Nga mice to evaluate its therapeutic effect on DNCB-induced AD. EGF treatment improved dermatitis score, ear thickness, epidermal hyperplasia, serum total immunoglobulin E level, and transepidermal water loss in NC/Nga mice with DNCB-induced AD. In addition, levels of skin barrier-related proteins such as filaggrin, involucrin, loricrin, occludin, and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) were increased by EGF treatment. These beneficial effects of EGF on AD may be mediated by EGF regulation of Th1/Th2-mediated cytokines, mast cell hyperplasia, and protease activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), which are triggers of AD. Taken together, our findings suggest that EGF may potentially protect against AD lesional skin via regulation of skin barrier function and immune response.">

Its potential of causing skin and ocular irritation was evaluated by the Repeated Insult Patch Test and the Hen's Egg Chorioallantoic Membrane Test, respectively.It was seen that 2% T4O formulation did not cause ocular irritation, skin irritation, sensitisation or allergic contact dermatitis in human subjects. Most importantly, it killed microorganisms listed in USP &lt;51&gt; at both 14 and 28 days and exerted a rapid killing effect within 60 s against 13 bacteria, 1 fungus and Acanthamoeba castellanii.The above finding suggests that 2% T4O formulation is safe and effective in killing microorganisms related to common ocular and skin infective diseases.Although the clinical efficacy in treating ocular disease was not directly studied; this foam formulation containing 2% T4O, based on the in vitro results of this work, demonstrated that it can potentially be used as a preservative-free cleansing agent for ocular hygiene maintenance due to its ability to exert a broad-spectrum antimicrobial effect without causing ocular or skin irritation.">

The present study aimed to document animal-based traditional therapies used by the local communities of Jhelum and Lahore districts of the Punjab province, Pakistan. METHODS:Field surveys were conducted in 2015-2016 in six different sites of the study areas. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews and face to face conversation with local informants. RESULTS:The ethnomedicinal uses of 57 species of animals including mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, amphibian, and invertebrates (30, 25, 25, 7, 3.5, and 3.5%, respectively) were documented. Meat, oil, brain, fats, milk, eggs, and skin were the most utilized body parts. Ovis orientalis punjabiensis, Francolinus francolinus, Sperata sarwari, Channa punctata, Oreochromis niloticus, Ctenopharyngodon idella, Cyprinus carpio, Labeo rohita, and Carassius auratus were reported for the first time to treat human diseases, i.e., allergy, epilepsy, fever, joint pain, and backache, to act as aphrodisiac, and to enhance memory. Streptopelia decaocto and S. tranquebarica were the most frequently utilized species with highest frequency of citation (32 for each). Columba livia depicted highest fidelity level and used value of 92.86% and 0.89, respectively. CONCLUSIONS:Being agro-pastoralists, the inhabitants of Jhelum possess more traditional knowledge compared to Lahore. The present study could be important for conservation and sustainable use of animal biodiversity in this region. Additionally, detailed study on chemical profiling and bioactivities may lead to animal-based novel drug discovery.">

The livestock market is being encouraged to use natural growth promotors, but information is limited about the PFA mode of action. The aim of this paper is to present the complexity of compounds present in essential oils (EOs) and factors that influence biological effects of PFA. In this paper, we highlight various controls and optimization parameters that influence the processes for the standardization of these products. The chemical composition of EOs depends on plant genetics, growth conditions, development stage at harvest, and processes of extracting active compounds. Their biological effects are further influenced by the interaction of phytochemicals and their bioavailability in the gastrointestinal tract of animals. PFA effects on animal health and production are also complex due to various EO antibiotic, antioxidant, anti-quorum sensing, anti-inflammatory, and digestive fluids stimulating activities. Research must focus on reliable methods to identify and control the quality and effects of EOs. In this study, we focused on available microencapsulation techniques of EOs to increase the bioavailability of active compounds, as well as their application in the animal feed additive industry.">

Due to the wide phytochemical composition of herbal extracts and the presence of alcohol in the emulsion system, which can cause skin irritation, sensitization or dryness when applied topically, the safety of the investigated drug delivery system is necessary. The aim of our study was to estimate the potential of W/O/W emulsions based on natural ingredients for skin irritation and phototoxicity using reconstructed 3D epidermis models in vitro and to evaluate in vivo its effect on human skin moisture, sebum content and pigmentation by biomedical examination using a dermatoscopic camera and corneometer. According to the results obtained after in vitro cell viability test the investigated emulsion was neither irritant nor phototoxic to human skin keratinocytes. W/O/W emulsion did not cause skin dryness in vivo, despite the fact that it contained ethanol. We can conclude that the emulsion is safe for use as a leave-on product due to the positive effect on human skin characteristics or as a semisolid pharmaceutical base where active compounds could be encapsulated.">

        <span class="abst" title="Evening primrose (Oenothera L.) is a plant belonging to the family Onagraceae, in which the most numerous species is Oenothera biennis. Some plants belonging to the genus Oenothera L. are characterized by biological activity. Therefore, studies were conducted to determine the dependence of biological activity on the chemical composition of various parts of the evening primrose, mainly leaves, stems, and seeds. Common components of all parts of the Oenothera biennis plants are fatty acids, phenolic acids, and flavonoids. In contrast, primrose seeds also contain proteins, carbohydrates, minerals, and vitamins. Therefore, it is believed that the most interesting sources of biologically active compounds are the seeds and, above all, evening primrose seed oil. This oil contains mainly aliphatic alcohols, fatty acids, sterols, and polyphenols. Evening primrose oil (EPO) is extremely high in linoleic acid (LA) (70⁻74%) and γ-linolenic acid (GLA) (8⁻10%), which may contribute to the proper functioning of human tissues because they are precursors of anti-inflammatory eicosanoids. EPO supplementation results in an increase in plasma levels of γ-linolenic acid and its metabolite dihomo-γ-linolenic acid (DGLA). This compound is oxidized by lipoxygenase (15-LOX) to 15-hydroxyeicosatrienoic acid (15-HETrE) or, under the influence of cyclooxygenase (COX), DGLA is metabolized to series 1 prostaglandins. These compounds have anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative properties. Furthermore, 15-HETrE blocks the conversion of arachidonic acid (AA) to leukotriene A₄ (LTA₄) by direct inhibition of 5-LOX. In addition, γ-linolenic acid suppresses inflammation mediators such as interleukin 1β (IL-1β), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and cytokine - tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). The beneficial effects of EPO have been demonstrated in the case of atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, Sjögren's syndrome, asthma, and anti-cancer therapy.">

        <span class="abst" title="Horse oil contains linoleic, palmitoleic and unsaturated fatty acids that are similar to those in human skin, and may therefore be an ideal substance from which to isolate biosurfactants for cosmetic products to improve human skin quality. Herein, an innovative approach was developed to synthesise sophorolipids from horse oil by hydrolysis, followed by fermentation using the yeast Candida bombicola. The yield of sophorolipids from direct fermentation of horse oil and hydrolysed horse oil was 40.6 ± 1.3 g l-1 and 58.4 ± 1.8 g l-1 respectively. To further increase the yield, 30-40 g l-1 glucose was added in a fed-batch fermentation process to maintain the pH between 4.0 and 4.5, resulting in a conversion yield of 71.7 ± 0.8 g l-1 . The purity and structure of the synthesised sophorolipids were analysed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance. An in vitro human dermal fibroblast model was used as a surrogate for human skin to measure elastase inhibition activity. Antiwrinkle properties of isolated sophorolipids were better than those of horse oil or hydrolysed horse oil in several in vitro assays. Furthermore, no cytotoxicity was observed at a concentration of 50 μg ml-1 , and wound-healing capacity was evident in a cell culture model. Additionally, the synthesised sophorolipids attenuated lipopolysaccharide-induced expression of inflammatory cytokines in macrophages, and efficiently inhibited several strains of bacteria and yeast. In conclusion, fed-batch fermentation of hydrolysed horse oil is a novel and efficient approach for producing high-quality and high-yield sophorolipids that exhibit great potential as cosmetic ingredients.">

        <span class="abst" title="Fish oil has been broadly reported as a potential supplement to ameliorate the severity of some skin disorders such as photoaging, skin cancer, allergy, dermatitis, cutaneous wounds, and melanogenesis. There has been increasing interest in the relationship of fish oil with skin protection and homeostasis, especially with respect to the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). The other PUFAs, such as α-linolenic acid (ALA) and linoleic acid (LA), also show a beneficial effect on the skin. The major mechanisms of PUFAs for attenuating cutaneous inflammation are the competition with the inflammatory arachidonic acid and the inhibition of proinflammatory eicosanoid production. On the other hand, PUFAs in fish oil can be the regulators that affect the synthesis and activity of cytokines for promoting wound healing. A systemic review was conducted to demonstrate the association between fish oil supplementation and the benefits to the skin. The following describes the different cosmetic and therapeutic approaches using fatty acids derived from fish oil, especially ALA, LA, DHA, and EPA. This review summarizes the cutaneous application of fish oil and the related fatty acids in the cell-based, animal-based, and clinical models. The research data relating to fish oil treatment of skin disorders suggest a way forward for generating advances in cosmetic and dermatological uses.">

A block randomization list was generated for 142 parturient divided into three groups. In the intervention group (arm A) (n = 47), chamomile oil was applied topically on abdominal region after the stability of the patient. Placebo group (arm B) (n = 47) received placebo oil and control group (arm C) (n = 48) had no intervention. A recovery program was used after surgery for all participants. The primary outcome was time to first flatus. Secondary outcomes were time to bowel sounds, defecation, return of appetite, hospital stay, and rate of nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain.Times to first flatus were significantly shorter in Group A (arm A vs. B, P &lt; 0.001 and arm A vs. C, P &lt; 0.001). In addition, time to first bowel sounds (arm A vs. B, P &lt; 0.001 and arm A vs. C, P &lt; 0.001) and return of appetite (arm A vs. B, P &lt; 0.001 and arm A vs. C, P &lt; 0.001) were significantly shorter in arm A.

(Lamiaceae) leaf produced the strongest antimicrobial effect, inhibiting the growth of C. albicans (MIC 128 μg/mL), S. aureus (MIC 256 μg/mL), E. faecalis (MIC 256 μg/mL) and P. aeruginosa (MIC 256 μg/mL). The leaf extract of Woodfordia floribunda Salisb. (Lythraceae) also exhibited significant effect against C. albicans (MIC 128 μg/mL), S. aureus (MIC 256 μg/mL) and E. faecalis (MIC 256 μg/mL). Rotheca serrata (L.) Steane &amp; Mabb. (Lamiaceae) leaf extract inhibited the growth of S. aureus (MIC 256 µg/mL) and C. albicans (MIC 256 µg/mL).&lt;label&gt;DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS&lt;/label&gt;The leaf extract of O. aristatus and W. floribunda exhibited a significant anti-candidal effect. Therefore, both of these plants can serve as prospective source materials for the development of new anti-candidal agents.">

        <span class="abst" title="Cosmetics are primarily applied to the skin; therefore, the association of cosmetic dyes with skin diseases or inflammation is a topic of great interest. Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is an interleukin 7-like cytokine that activates dendritic cells to promote Th2 inflammatory immune responses. TSLP is highly expressed in keratinocytes under inflammatory conditions, which suggests that it may play a critical role in the development of skin diseases, such as atopic dermatitis. Therefore, we investigated whether cosmetic dyes influenced the production of TSLP by keratinocytes. Phloxine O, also known as D&amp;C Red No.27, is one of the most common red synthetic pigments and is widely used in colored cosmetics. Our results showed that Phloxine O downregulated phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced production of TSLP in a murine keratinocyte cell line (PAM212). Phloxine O also suppressed TSLP expression in KCMH-1 cells, which are mouse keratinocytes that constitutively produce high levels of TSLP. To investigate the in vivo effects of Phloxine O, we induced TSLP expression in mouse ear skin by topically applying MC903, a vitamin D3 analogue that is a well-known inducer of atopic dermatitis-like symptoms. Topical application of Phloxine O prevented MC903-induced TSLP production in mouse ear skin, attenuated the acute dermatitis-like symptoms and decreased serum IgE and histamine levels in mice. Suppression of TSLP expression by Phloxine O correlated with reduced expression of OX40 ligand and Th2 cytokines in mouse ear skin. Our results showed that Phloxine O may be beneficial to prevent dermatitis by suppressing the expression of TSLP and Th2 cytokines in skin.">

The aim of this study was to isolate essential oils from these leaves through steam distillation (SD) and solvent-free microwave extraction (SFME) and to evaluate their applicability to skin care by analyzing their antimicrobial, antioxidant (diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl scavenging assay, β-carotene/linoleic acid assay, and nitric oxide scavenging assay), anti-inflammatory (5-lipoxygenase inhibition assay), and antityrosinase activities. The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry results indicated that the main components of 'Mato Peiyu' leaf essential oils were citronellal and citronellol, with a total percentage of 50.71% and 59.82% for SD and SFME, respectively. The highest bioactivity among all assays was obtained for 5-lipoxygenase inhibition, with an IC50 value of 0.034% (v/v). The MIC90 of the antimicrobial activity of essential oils against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans ranged from 0.086% to 0.121% (v/v). Citronellal and citronellol were the main contributors, accounting for at least 54.58% of the essential oil's bioactivity. This paper is the first to report the compositions and bioactivities of 'Mato Peiyu' leaf essential oil, and the results imply that the pomelo leaf essential oil may be applied in skin care.">

Patients and methods:A 12-product kit was supplied to patients before chemotherapy began and was to be used throughout the treatment phase. Cutaneous adverse events were evaluated at each treatment session. Physicians evaluated skin reactions (edema, erythema, dryness, desquamation, pigmentation disorders, and cracks) and gave their opinion on the skin benefit for patients at the end of the study. Patients also evaluated the product benefit using the Patient Benefit Index (PBI) questionnaire. Results were analyzed by subgroups of casual and regular users, based on number and frequency of products used. Results:A total of 147 patients were enrolled in cancer services in Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and Canada. Mean age was 59 years with 71% being female. Product tolerance on whole body was rated good to excellent for at least 89% of the patients for each product. Aggravated skin reactions during the study were reported more frequently by casual users than regular users (39.5% versus 22%; p=0.029). Similarly, casual users reported more erythema aggravation (p=0.02) and desquamation (p=0.03) than regular users. PBI &gt;1 was reported for 95.5% of patients and regular users had significantly higher scores than casual users (p=0.049). Discussion:Overall, the 12-product kit was very well tolerated, with regular users reporting benefits more frequently than casual users. Results support international recommendations to use appropriate skin care products to minimize the impact of cutaneous reactions associated with chemotherapy.">

Topical drugs have been used for the management of skin infections. The growing concern of drug resistance to the topical agents has warned the need for continuous development of novel drug. Essential oils are the best candidate for new drug with different mode of action and target as they are rich in chemical constituents. Objective:To evaluate and develop safe and effective topical antimicrobial formulations from essential oil of Cymbopogon martini. Method. Essential oil was extracted using hydrodistillation aerial part C. martini and topical formulations were prepared in five different semisolid bases. In vitro antimicrobial investigations were performed on essential oil and topical formulations. Skin sensitizations of the formulations were evaluated using guinea pig maximization. Results:The essential oil of C. martini has shown broad-spectrum antimicrobial potency against all tested organisms with MIC value ranging from 0.65 to 10 μg/ml. Absolute inhibitions of growth of fungi were observed against Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Trichophyton rubrum at concentrations above 1% of oil and against Microsporum canis and Trichophyton verrucosum at a concentration of 4% oil. Among topical formulations, the highest antimicrobial activity was recorded in hydrophilic ointment followed by macrogol blend ointment. The antimicrobial activity of oil was higher in fungal pathogen compared to bacteria. Gram positive bacteria were more sensitive than gram negative bacteria. Hydrophilic and macrogol blend ointment containing 5% oil did not produce any skin sensitization on guinea pigs. Conclusion:In conclusion, topical formulations of C. martini essential oil can be alternative topical agents with safe broad-spectrum activity for the treatment of skin disorder. Further studies should focus on shelf life study and clinical study of the product.">

There is a growing need for natural compounds that will protect these sensitive molecules from damage, without harmful side effects. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of sea buckthorn seed oil on the redox balance and lipid metabolism in UV irradiated cells formed different skin layers to examine whether it had a protective effect. Human keratinocytes and fibroblasts were subjected to UVA (ultraviolet type A; 30 J/cm² and 20 J/cm²) or UVB (ultraviolet type B; 60 mJ/cm² and 200 mJ/cm², respectively) radiation and treated with sea buckthorn seed oil (500 ng/mL), and the redox activity was estimated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and enzymatic/non-enzymatic antioxidants activity/level (using electron spin resonance (ESR), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and spectrophotometry). Lipid metabolism was measured by the level of fatty acids, lipid peroxidation products, endocannabinoids and phospholipase A2 activity (GC/MS (gas chromatography/mass spectrometry), LC/MS (liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry), and spectrophotometry). Also, transcription factor Nrf2 (nuclear erythroid 2-related factor) and its activators/inhibitors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) and cannabinoid receptor levels were measured (Western blot). Sea buckthorn oil partially prevents UV-induced ROS generation and enhances the level of non-enzymatic antioxidants such as glutathione (GSH), thioredoxin (Trx) and vitamins E and A. Moreover, it stimulates the activity of Nrf2 leading to enhanced antioxidant enzyme activity. As a result, decreases in lipid peroxidation products (4-hydroxynonenal, 8-isoprostaglandin) and increases in the endocannabinoid receptor levels were observed. Moreover, sea buckthorn oil treatment enhanced the level of phospholipid and free fatty acids, while simultaneously decreasing the cannabinoid receptor expression in UV irradiated keratinocytes and fibroblasts. The main differences in sea buckthorn oil on various skin cell types was observed in the case of PPARs-in keratinocytes following UV radiation PPAR expression was decreased by sea buckthorn oil treatment, while in fibroblasts the reverse effect was observed, indicating an anti-inflammatory effect. With these results, sea buckthorn seed oil exhibited prevention of UV-induced disturbances in redox balance as well as lipid metabolism in skin fibroblasts and keratinocytes, which indicates it is a promising natural compound in skin photo-protection.">

While culture-independent techniques have revealed the role of the gut microbiome in human health and disease, the role of the cutaneous microbiome in wound healing is less defined. Skin commensals are essential in the maintenance of the epithelial barrier function, regulation of the host immune system, and protection from invading pathogenic microorganisms. In this review, we summarize the literature derived from pre-clinical and clinical studies on how changes in the microbiome of various acute and chronic skin wounds impact wound healing tissue regeneration. Furthermore, we review the mechanistic insights garnered from model wound healing systems. Finally, in the face of growing concern about antibiotic-resistance, we will discuss alternative strategies for the treatment of infected wounds to improve wound healing and outcomes. Taken together, it has become apparent that commensals, symbionts, and pathogens on human skin have an intimate role in the inflammatory response that highlights several potential strategies to treat infected, non-healing wounds. Despite these promising results, there are some contradictory and controversial findings from existing studies and more research is needed to define the role of the human skin microbiome in acute and chronic wound healing.">

        <span class="abst" title="Torreya grandis Fort. ex Lindl. is a plant belonging to the Taxaceae family and Torreya grandis cv. Merrillii is the only grafted and thoroughbred species belonging to this species. In this study, we extracted five different seed oils, including T. grandis seed oil (TGSO), T. grandis &quot;Xiangyafei&quot; seed oil (XYSO), T. grandis &quot;Zhimafei&quot; seed oil (ZMSO), T. grandis &quot;Majus&quot;seed oil (TGMSO), and T. grandis &quot;cunguangfei&quot; seed oil (CGSO) using physical pressure. The resulting extracts were analyzed to determine their fatty acid composition, antioxidant activity, and inhibitory activity towards tyrosinase. The results of the antioxidant activity assays revealed that XYSO and ZMSO exhibited much greater DPPH radical scavenging activity and ferric reducing power than TGSO. Notably, all five of the seed oils showed dose-dependent inhibitory activity towards tyrosinase. XYSO and TGSO gave the highest activities of all of the seed oils tested in the current study against monophenolase and diphenolase, with IC50 values of 227.0 and 817.5μg/mL, respectively. The results of this study show that wild TGSOs exhibit strong antioxidant and tyrosinase inhibition activities. These results therefore suggest that wild TGSOs could be used as a potential source of natural antioxidant agents and tyrosinase inhibitors.">

New emollients have been introduced recently and are assumed to be therapeutically interchangeable with the innovator products because, superficially, they appear to have similar compositions. This study compares a) the ex vivo human skin occlusion performance and b) the visual and microscopic properties of Isomol gel (IMG) and Doublebase gel (DBG). Materials and Methods:Occlusion was measured gravimetrically by reduction in cumulative 48-hour evaporative weight loss from ex vivo human skin samples following single applications of the two test emollients and Vaseline®. Skin samples from a single donor were mounted in Franz diffusion cells and then the emollients were spread over the skin surface with an applied dose of approximately 2 mg/cm2. The assemblies (four replicates per treatment) were then accurately weighed at baseline (T0) and again after 5-, 24-, and 48-hour postapplication. The quality of the two emollient gel formulations was compared by visual examination of their film-forming characteristics and by microstructural examination using environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM). Results:Occlusivity of the DBG emollient gel formulation was comparable with Vaseline and substantially better than IMG, with the DBG-treated skin samples losing less than half as much weight as the IMG-treated skin samples over 48 hours and at a much slower rate during the first 5 hours. The film-forming characteristics and microstructure of the gels were also very different. Whereas DBG maintained a smooth, uniform film over 24 hours, the IMG formulation phase-separated. ESEM results showed that the DBG emulsion has a stable structural matrix with uniform oil droplets, whereas for IMG the emulsion system is inhomogeneous with the oil phase coalescing into larger irregular shaped rafts. Conclusions:We have demonstrated substantial performance differences between two prescribed emollient gels.">

Arboviruses and parasites are transmitted to humans from arthropods, and mosquitoes are the most common arthropods associated with dengue, malaria, and yellow fever. Enormous efforts have been made to develop effective repellents against arthropods, and thus far synthetic repellents have been widely used. However, the use of synthetic repellents has raised several concerns in terms of environmental and human health risks and safety. Thus, plant essential oils (EOs) have been widely used as an alternative to synthetic repellents. In this review, we briefly introduce and summarize recent studies that have investigated EOs as insect repellents. Current technology and research trends to develop effective and safe repellents from plant EOs are also described in this review.">

In this study, KMO was formulated in an oil-in-water nanoemulsion as a carrier for better penetration into the skin. Methods:The nanoemulsion was prepared by using high and low energy emulsification technique. D-optimal mixture experimental design was generated as a tool for optimizing the composition of nanoemulsions suitable for topical delivery systems. Effects of formulation variables including KMO (2.0%-10.0% w/w), mixture of castor oil (CO):lemon essential oil (LO; 9:1) (1.0%-5.0% w/w), Tween 80 (1.0%-4.0% w/w), xanthan gum (0.5%-1.5% w/w), and deionized water (78.8%-94.8% w/w), on droplet size as a response were determined. Results:Analysis of variance showed that the fitness of the quadratic polynomial fits the experimental data with F-value (2,479.87), a low P-value (P&lt;0.0001), and a nonsignificant lack of fit. The optimized formulation of KMO-enriched nanoemulsion with desirable criteria was KMO (10.0% w/w), Tween 80 (3.19% w/w), CO:LO (3.74% w/w), xanthan gum (0.70% w/w), and deionized water (81.68% w/w). This optimum formulation showed good agreement between the actual droplet size (110.01 nm) and the predicted droplet size (111.73 nm) with a residual standard error &lt;2.0%. The optimized formulation with pH values (6.28) showed high conductivity (1,492.00 µScm-1) and remained stable under accelerated stability study during storage at 4°C, 25°C, and 45°C for 90 days, centrifugal force as well as freeze-thaw cycles. Rheology measurement justified that the optimized formulation was more elastic (shear thinning and pseudo-plastic properties) rather than demonstrating viscous characteristics. In vitro cytotoxicity of the optimized KMO formulation and KMO oil showed that IC50 (50% inhibition of cell viability) value was &gt;100 µg/mL. Conclusion:The survival rate of 3T3 cell on KMO formulation (54.76%) was found to be higher compared to KMO oil (53.37%) without any toxicity sign. This proved that the KMO formulation was less toxic and can be applied for cosmeceutical applications.">

In support of that, IL-17C was demonstrated to contribute to development of T cell-dependent imiquimod-induced psoriatic dermatitis and T cell-independent dextran sodium sulfate-induced acute colitis using mice deficient in IL-17C and/or IL-17RE, which is a component of the receptor for IL-17C. However, the roles of IL-17C in other inflammatory diseases remain poorly understood. Therefore, we investigated the contributions of IL-17C to development of certain disease models using Il17c-/- mice, which we newly generated. Those mice showed normal development of T cell-dependent inflammatory diseases such as FITC- and DNFB-induced contact dermatitis/contact hypersensitivity (CHS) and concanavalin A-induced hepatitis, and T cell-independent inflammatory diseases such as bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, papain-induced airway eosinophilia and LPS-induced airway neutrophilia. On the other hand, those mice were highly resistant to LPS-induced endotoxin shock, indicating that IL-17C is crucial for protection against that immunological reaction. Therefore, IL-17C neutralization may represent a novel therapeutic approach for sepsis, in addition to psoriasis and acute colitis.">

In the present study, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) of C. obtusa and P. densiflora were examined to determine whether they have anti-inflammatory capabilities. To evaluate the anti-inflammatory effects of VOCs of C. obtusa and P. densiflora, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was administered to the lung by nasal injection and to the whole body by intraperitoneal injection. Alterations in serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels and prostaglandin E2 (PgE2) were examined using ELISA. LPS-increased serum IgE and PgE2 levels were recovered by administration of dexamethasone and VOCs of C. obtusa and P. densiflora. Levels of mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines were determined in an LPS-induced inflammation mouse model. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to determine the mRNA expression levels of cyclooxygenase 2, interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and IL-13 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The expression of all examined cytokine mRNAs increased by LPS was suppressed by dexamethasone and VOCs of C. obtusa and P. densiflora. Similar tendencies were observed in lung tissues and cells obtained via bronchoalveolar lavage. The results of the present study suggested that VOCs of C. obtusa and P. densiflora, through their immunosuppressive activities, may have therapeutic potential in the treatment or prevention of inflammation.">

For example, the term cosmeceutical was first coined by Albert Kligman in 1984 to describe topical products that afford both cosmetic and therapeutic benefits. However, beauty comes from the inside. Therefore, for some time scientists have considered how nutrition reflects healthy skin and the aging process. The more recent link between nutrition and skin aging began in earnest around the year 2000 with the demonstrated increase in peer-reviewed scientific journal reports on this topic that included biochemical and molecular mechanisms of action. Thus, the application of: (a) topical administration from outside into the skin and (b) inside by oral consumption of nutritionals to the outer skin layers is now common place and many journal reports exhibit significant improvement for both on a variety of dermal parameters. Therefore, this review covers, where applicable, the history, chemical structure, and sources such as biological and biomedical properties in the skin along with animal and clinical data on the oral applications of: (a) collagen, (b) ceramide, (c) β-carotene, (d) astaxanthin, (e) coenzyme Q10, (f) colostrum, (g) zinc, and (h) selenium in their mode of action or function in improving dermal health by various quantified endpoints. Lastly, the importance of the human skin microbiome is briefly discussed in reference to the genomics, measurement, and factors influencing its expression and how it may alter the immune system, various dermal disorders, and potentially be involved in chemoprevention.">

The purposes of this study were to characterize the polyphenols extracted from Melaleuca styphelioides leaves and assess their potential antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. The polyphenol extracts were prepared by maceration with solvents of increasing polarity. The LC/MS-MS technique was used to identify and quantify the phenolic compounds. An assessment of the radical scavenging activity of all extracts was performed using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2'-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonate) (ABTS⁺), and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays. The anti-inflammatory activity was determined on interferon gamma (IFN-γ)/histamine (H)-stimulated human NCTC 2544 keratinocytes by Western blot and RT-PCR. Compared to other solvents, methanolic extract presented the highest level of phenolic contents. The most frequent phenolic compounds were quercetin, followed by gallic acid and ellagic acid. DPPH, ABTS⁺, and FRAP assays showed that methanolic extract exhibits strong concentration-dependent antioxidant activity. IFN-γ/H treatment of human NCTC 2544 keratinocytes induced the secretion of high levels of the pro-inflammatory mediator inter-cellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), which were inhibited by extract. In conclusion, the extract of Melaleuca styphelioides leaves is rich in flavonoids, and presents antioxidant and anti-inflammatory proprieties. It can be proposed as a useful compound to treat inflammatory skin diseases.">

Some clinical signs are typical for a specific AIBD, however, correct diagnosis requires the detection of tissue-bound or circulating autoantibodies. The gold standard for diagnosis of AIBD is the detection of autoantibodies or complement component 3 by direct immunofluorescence (DIF) microscopy of a perilesional biopsy. Circulating antibodies can be detected via indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) microscopy of different tissue substrates including human skin, monkey esophagus, and more recently, recombinant forms of the different target antigens. Latter are also employed in various commercial ELISA systems and by immunoblotting in in-house assays available in specialized laboratories. ELISA systems are also particularly valuable for monitoring of the disease activity during the disease course which can be helpful for treatment decisions. Exact diagnosis is essential for both treatment and prognosis, since some AIBD are associated with malign tumors such as paraneoplastic pemphigus and anti-laminin 332 mucous membrane pemphigoid. This review presents clinical and immunopathological features of AIBD for the state-of the art diagnosis of these disorders.">

        <span class="abst" title="Antibiotics are often prescribed in acne treatment; however, Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis, the two of the major acne-associated bacteria, developed antibiotic resistance. Essential oils (EOs) present a natural, safe, efficacious and multifunctional alternative treatment. This study aimed to assess the potential anti-acne activity of selected seven EOs commonly used in Mediterranean folk medicine. Antimicrobial activity screening of these oils showed oregano to exhibit the strongest antimicrobial activity with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 0.34 mg/mL and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of 0.67 mg/mL against P. acnes; and MIC of 0.67 mg/mL and MBC of 1.34 mg/mL against S. epidermidis. The composition of the most effective EOs (oregano and thyme) was determined using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Monoterpenoid phenols predominated oregano and thyme EO with thymol percentile 99 and 72, respectively. Thymol showed MIC 0.70 mg/mL against both P. acnes and S. epidermidis whereas MBC was 1.40 and 2.80 mg/mL against P. acnes and S. epidermidis, respectively. Moreover, oregano exhibited the strongest anti-biofilm effect against S. epidermidis with MBIC 1.34 mg/mL and killing dynamic time of 12 and 8 h against P. acnes and S. epidermidis, respectively. Oregano, the most effective EO, was formulated and tested as a nanoemulsion in an acne animal mouse model. The formulation showed superior healing and antimicrobial effects compared to the reference antibiotic. Collectively, our data suggested that oregano oil nanoemulsion is a potential natural and effective alternative for treating acne and overcoming the emerging antibiotic resistance.">

        <span class="abst" title="The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AdMSCs) on atopic dermatitis (AD) in the BALB/c mouse model. The AdMSCs attenuated clinical symptoms associated with AD, decreased numbers of degranulated mast cells (MCs), IgE level, amount of histamine released, and prostaglandin E2 level. Atopic dermatitis increased the expression levels of cytokines/chemokines, such as interleukin-5 (IL-5), macrophage inflammatory protein-1ß (MIP-1ß), MIP-2, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5 (CCL5), and IL-17, in BALB/c mouse. The AdMSCs showed decreased expression levels of these cytokines in the mouse model of AD. In vivo downregulation of MIP-2 attenuated the clinical symptoms associated with AD. Atopic dermatitis increased the expression levels of hallmarks of allergic inflammation, induced interactions of Fc𝜀RIβ with histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) and Lyn, increased ß-hexosaminidase activity, increased serum IgE level, and increased the amount of histamine released in an MIP-2-dependent manner. Downregulation of MIP-2 increased the levels of several miRNAs, including miR-122a-5p. Mouse miR-122a-5p mimic inhibited AD, while suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1), a predicted downstream target of miR-122a-5p, was required for AD. The downregulation of SOCS1 decreased the expression levels of MIP-2 and chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 13 (CXCL13) in the mouse model of AD. The downregulation of CXCL13 attenuated AD and allergic inflammation such as passive cutaneous anaphylaxis. The role of T cell transcription factors in AD was also investigated. Atopic dermatitis increased the expression levels of T-bet and GATA-3 [transcription factors of T-helper 1 (Th1) and T-helper 2 (Th2) cells, respectively] but decreased the expression of Foxp3, a transcription factor of regulatory T (Treg) cells, in an SOCS1-dependent manner. In addition to this, miR-122a-5p mimic also prevented AD from regulating the expression of T-bet, GATA-3, and Foxp3. Atopic dermatitis increased the expression of cluster of differentiation 163 (CD163), a marker of M2 macrophages, but decreased the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), a marker of M1 macrophages. Additionally, SOCS1 and miR-122a-5p mimic regulated the expression of CD163 and iNOS in the mouse model of AD. Experiments employing conditioned medium showed interactions between MCs and macrophages in AD. The conditioned medium of AdMSCs, but not the conditioned medium of human dermal fibroblasts, negatively inhibited the features of allergic inflammation. In summary, we investigated the anti-atopic effects of AdMSCs, identified targets of AdMSCs, and determined the underlying mechanism for the anti-atopic effects of AdMSCs.">

Further, the social stigma and secrecy surrounding STIs create difficulty in estimating its true incidence and prevalence. Objective:The objective of this study was to know the pattern of diseases including different clinical presentations and final diagnosis among the STI clinic attendees. Materials and Methods:This study was a hospital-based study; a predesigned and pretested schedule was used to collect data from 140 patients after obtaining their consent. The study was carried out between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2016. Statistical Analysis:Analysis was done using tabulation and proportion. Results and Observation:Genital ulcer (31.43%) was the most common clinical presentation among the attendees. Primary syphilis was the most common (17.14%) STI detected among the participants followed by herpes genitalis (16.43%). The most common mixed infection was primary syphilis with chancroid (36.36%) followed by herpes genitalis with primary syphilis (18.18%). Conclusion:Ulcerative STIs singly or in combination are more frequent than the non-ulcerative STIs. Further studies with large sample sizes are needed to obtain a more vivid picture.">

HPV annually caused over 500,000 cancer cases including cervical, anogenital and oropharyngeal cancer among others. HPV vaccination has become a public-health concern, worldwide, to prevent the cases of HPV infections including precancerous lesions, cervical cancers, and genital warts especially in adolescent female and male population by launching national programs with international alliances. Currently, available prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines are expensive to be used in developing countries for vaccination programs. The recent progress in immunotherapy, biotechnology, recombinant DNA technology and molecular biology along with alternative and complementary medicinal systems have paved novel ways and valuable opportunities to design and develop effective prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines, drugs and treatment approach to counter HPV effectively. Exploration and more researches on such advances could result in the gradual reduction in the incidences of HPV cases across the world. The present review presents a current global scenario and futuristic prospects of the advanced prophylactic and therapeutic approaches against HPV along with recent patents coverage of the progress and advances in drugs, vaccines and therapeutic regimens to effectively combat HPV infections and its cancerous conditions.">

This cultivation medium derived from waste was found to be a comparatively better source of nutrients than standard culture media because it provided more than one type of usable carbon source(s) to yeast. RESULTS:HPLC results showed that the extract contained glucose, xylose and glycerol along with other carbon sources, allowing triauxic growth pattern with preferably usage of glucose, xylose and glycerol resulting in enhanced growth, lipid and carotenoid production. Presence of saturated and unsaturated fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) (C14-20) in the lipid profile showed that the lipid may be transesterified for biodiesel production. CONCLUSION:Upscaling these experiments to fermenter scale for the production of lipids and biodiesel and other industrially useful products would lead to waste management along with the production of value added commodities. The technique is thus environment friendly and gives good return upon investment.">

A systematic review of studies describing the cytotoxic role of C officinalis and its therapeutic role on cancer cells were carried out using the PubMed database. Albeit C officinalis extracts have cytotoxic activity toward different cancer cell lines, a high grade of variation between studies was observed, depending on plant organ subjected to extraction, extraction method, and the cancer cell lines used for each study. Nevertheless, its cytotoxic activity is related to a few bioactive compounds, presenting multiple roles in both activation of proapoptotic proteins and decreasing the expression of the proteins that inhibit cell death. Moreover, due to its anti-genotoxic/protective as well as antitumor and antimetastatic effects proven in animal models, C officinalis could have important future implications in developing novel cancer treatment strategies, while until now it has been used especially for diminishing the side effects of radiotherapy.">

It seems that two complexes of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, mTORC1 and mTORC2, are congruent with the two bases of the Traditional Iranian Medicine (TIM) therapy, Cold and Hot nature, which are essential for the efficacy of functional oils for controlling immune responses in autoimmune diseases. Methods: We searched PubMed database, Web of Science (WOS), Google Scholar, Scopus and selected studies by predefined eligibility criteria. We then assessed their quality and extracted data. Results: The oils controlled by Cold or Hot nature may be helpful in maintaining homeostasis and preventing autoimmune diseases. In summary, studies of randomized controlled trials for allergy and cancer patients found no improvement in the signs or response to tests, despite a remarkable change in EFA fractions in the blood by supplementation with sources of borage, evening primrose, hemp seed and fish oils. In contrast, portulaca oleracea oil exhibited protective effects by anti-inflammatory properties via the PI3K/Akt/mTORC2 pathway with a deviation immune response to Th1 to treat atopic diseases and cancer. Conclusions: According to the concept of Traditional Iranian Medicine therapy, in contrast to Cold-nature oils, EFA supplementation with the sources of Hot-nature oilsis not suitable for the treatment of atopic and cancerous diseases.">

To alleviate pruritus, lipid replenishing and rehydration of the skin is often unsatisfactory. Thus, products with additional antipruritic effects are needed. Objectives:Antipruritic effects and cosmetic properties of two different emulsions, water-in-oil (w/o) or oil-in-water (o/w), and a shampoo containing a lipophilic Echinacea purpurea root extract (Ec.-extract) were assessed in adults suffering from pruritus. Methods:Adults (n = 55) with pruritus of the body applied a w/o emulsion for 2 weeks. In a separate study, adults (n = 33) with a pruritic scalp applied an o/w-emulsion for 4 weeks. In a third study, shampoo (n = 34) was applied for 4 weeks. Objective (erythema, dryness, and papules) and subjective (intensity, duration, and burden of pruritus) parameters were assessed. Results:Treatment with the w/o emulsion significantly reduced erythema and dryness (P &lt; 0.0001) as well as pruritus (in 93% of participants) on the body. Treatment with the o/w-emulsion on the scalp significantly (P &lt; 0.0001) reduced objective (erythema in 61% and dryness in 85% of participants) and subjective (85% of participants had reduced pruritus) parameters. Similar results in reduction of dryness (76% of participants) and pruritus (70 % of participants) were seen after 4 weeks of shampoo use. Conclusion:Independent from the type of emulsion (w/o or o/w), cosmetic products containing a proprietary Ec.-extract significantly reduced objective and subjective parameters in adults suffering from acute or chronic pruritus exhibiting excellent tolerability.">

        <span class="abst" title="The recent rapid growth in dermal filler use, in conjunction with inadequate product and injector control, has heralded a concerning increase in filler complications. The 10-point plan has been developed to minimize complications through careful preconsideration of causative factors, categorized as patient, product, and procedure related. Patient-related factors include history, which involves a preprocedural consultation with careful elucidation of skin conditions, systemic disease, medications, and previous cosmetic procedures. Other exclusion criteria include autoimmune diseases and multiple allergies. The temporal proximity of dental or routine medical procedures is discouraged. Insightful patient assessment, with the consideration of ethnicity, gender, and generational needs, is of paramount importance. Specified informed consent is vital due to the concerning increase in vascular complications, which carry the risk for skin compromise and loss of vision. Informed consent should be signed for both adverse events and their treatment. Product-related factors include reversibility, which is a powerful advantage when using hyaluronic acid (HA) products. Complications from nonreversible or minimally degradable products, especially when layered over vital structures, are more difficult to control. Product characteristics such as HA concentration and proprietary cross-linking should be understood in the context of ideal depth, placement, and expected duration. Product layering over late or minimally degradable fillers is discouraged, while layering of HA of over the same brand, or even across brands, seems to be feasible. Procedural factors such as photographic documentation, procedural planning, aseptic technique, and anatomical and technical knowledge are of pivotal importance. A final section is dedicated to algorithms and protocols for the management and treatment of complications such as hypersensitivity, vascular events, infection, and late-onset nodules. The 10-point plan is a systematic, effective strategy aimed at reducing the risk of dermal filler complications.">

It can have severe psychological effects and can leave the patient with severe skin scarring. There are four well-recognized pathological factors responsible for acne which is also the target for acne therapy. In this review, different treatment options are discussed, including topical (i.e., retinoids, and antibiotics) and systemic (i.e., retinoids, antibiotics, and hormonal) treatments. Since the general public has been showing an increasing interest in more natural and generally safer treatment options, the use of complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) for treating acne was also discussed. The use of physical therapies such as comedone extraction, cryoslush therapy, cryotherapy, electrocauterization, intralesional corticosteroids and optical treatments are also mentioned. Acne has been extensively researched with regards to the disease mechanism as well as treatment options. However, due to the increasing resistance of Propionibacterium acnes towards the available antibiotics, there is a need for new treatment methods. Additionally, the lack of necessary evidence on the efficacy of CAM therapies makes it necessary for researchers to investigate these treatment options further.">

It is externally applied as a treatment for a wide range of skin conditions such as eczema, psoriasis, hair loss, burns, topical wounds, and atopic dermatitis. Deoxyshikonin is the major angiogenic compound extracted from LR. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of LR extract and deoxyshikonin on impaired wound healing in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice. Treatment with LR extract elevated tube formation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and exerted antioxidant activity. An open skin wound was produced on the backs of diabetic mice and was then topically treated with deoxyshikonin or vehicle. In addition, deoxyshikonin promoted tube formation in high glucose conditions exposed to HUVECs, and which may be regulated by increased VEGFR2 expression and phosphorylation of Akt and p38. Our results demonstrate that deoxyshikonin application promoted wound repair in STZ-induced diabetic mice. Collectively, these data suggest that deoxyshikonin is an active ingredient of LR, thereby contributing to wound healing in patients with diabetes.">

        <span class="abst" title="Background:Trombidid mites have a unique life cycle in which only the larval stage is ectoparasitic. In the superfamily Trombiculoidea (&quot;chiggers&quot;), the larvae feed preferentially on vertebrates, including humans. Species in the genus Leptotrombidium are vectors of a potentially fatal bacterial infection, scrub typhus, that affects 1 million people annually. Moreover, chiggers can cause pruritic dermatitis (trombiculiasis) in humans and domesticated animals. In the Trombidioidea (velvet mites), the larvae feed on other arthropods and are potential biological control agents for agricultural pests. Here, we present the first trombidid mites genomes, obtained both for a chigger, Leptotrombidium deliense, and for a velvet mite, Dinothrombium tinctorium. Results:Sequencing was performed using Illumina technology. A 180 Mb draft assembly for D. tinctorium was generated from two paired-end and one mate-pair library using a single adult specimen. For L. deliense, a lower-coverage draft assembly (117 Mb) was obtained using pooled, engorged larvae with a single paired-end library. Remarkably, both genomes exhibited evidence of ancient lateral gene transfer from soil-derived bacteria or fungi. The transferred genes confer functions that are rare in animals, including terpene and carotenoid synthesis. Thirty-seven allergenic protein families were predicted in the L. deliense genome, of which nine were unique. Preliminary proteomic analyses identified several of these putative allergens in larvae. Conclusions:Trombidid mite genomes appear to be more dynamic than those of other acariform mites. A priority for future research is to determine the biological function of terpene synthesis in this taxon and its potential for exploitation in disease control.">

While several beneficial effects of placenta extracts on wound healing, anti-aging and anti-inflammatory responses have been reported, relatively limited mechanistic exploration has been conducted to date. Here, we provide compelling evidence of anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative activities of porcine placenta extracts (PPE) against contact dermatitis in vivo. METHODS:A contact dermatitis mouse model was established by sensitizing the dorsal skin of BALB/c mice using the contact allergen, 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB), and molecular consequences of topical application of PPE were investigated. PPEs were pre-sterilized via γ-irradiation, which is a milder but more effective way of sterilizing biomolecules relative to the conventional autoclaving method. RESULTS:DNCB-induced skin lesions displayed clear contact dermatitis-like symptoms and topical application of PPE dramatically alleviated both local and systemic inflammatory responses. Inflammatory epidermal thickening was completely abrogated and allergen-specific serum IgE levels significantly reduced in the presence of PPE. Moreover, anti-oxidative activities of PPE were observed both in vitro and in vivo, which may lead to attenuation of inflammatory responses. Prolonged treatment with PPE strongly inhibited production of DNCB-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) and subsequently prevented oxidative degradation of hyaluronic acid (HA), which triggers innate inflammatory responses. CONCLUSION:Our findings supply valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory effects of PPE and provide a functional basis for the clinical application of PPE in inflammatory diseases.">

Many plants are known to have innate antimicrobial action and can be used as alternatives to antibiotics; thus, it is necessary to prove their effectiveness in vivo. This study aimed to evaluate the anti-acne efficacy of a new cream based on three natural extracts, comparing it to erythromycin cream and placebo. Patients and methods:Sixty patients with mild to moderate acne vulgaris were randomly divided into three groups: treated with cream containing 20% propolis, 3% &quot;tea tree oil&quot;, and 10% &quot;Aloe vera&quot; (PTAC) (n=20); or with 3 % erythromycin cream (ERC) (n=20); or with placebo (n=20). At baseline, after 15 and 30 days, investigators evaluated response to treatment by counting acne lesions through noninvasive measurements and macrophotography. Results:All the clinical and instrumental values studied were statistically different from placebo except for sebometry, pHmetry, and erythema index values, measured on healthy skin. Unlike in the placebo group, papular and scar lesions showed high erythema reduction after 15 and 30 days of PTAC and ERC application. Conclusion:The PTAC formulation was better than ERC in reducing erythema scars, acne severity index, and total lesion count.">

        <span class="abst" title="Zanthoxylum coreanum Nakai is a rare shrub which grows in Korea and China. Pericarp of Z. coreanum has been used as a crude medicine, but there are few researches about the pharmacologic activities. The present study was designed to investigate the anti-allergic inflammatory activities of the essential oil from fruits of Zanthoxylum coreanum Nakai (ZCO). Our findings showed that ZCO inhibited both the IgE-antigen complex or PMA/A23187-induced β-hexosaminidase release and IL-4 production dose-dependently in RBL-2H3 mast cells, and confirmed that ZCO at the tested concentrations did not show cytotoxicity to RBL-2H3 cells by MTS assay. Additionally, we found that ZCO showed the significant inhibition on LPS-induced overproduction of TNF-α, IL-6 and NO. Consistently, the protein levels of iNOS and COX-2 were also remarkably decreased by ZCO treatment. Herein, Our mechanistic studies revealed that ZCO significantly suppressed the activation of transcription factor NF-κB in PMA-activated 293T cells, and further inhibited NF-κB p65 translocation into the nucleus in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. Further investigation identified that ZCO down-regulated LPS-induced phosphorylation of MAPK (JNK, ERK, and p38) signal pathway. For incremental research, we established an DNCB-induced atopic dermatitis model in BALB/c mice, and found that ZCO remarkably inhibited DNCB-induced ear swelling and AD-like symptoms. Based on these findings, ZCO is suggested to have a therapeutic potential for the allergic inflammatory diseases.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Fleagrass, Adenosma buchneroides, is an aromatic perennial herb that occupies an important position in the life of the Akha people. They regard it as a tribal symbol and a gift of love. Fleagrass also has many medicinal uses, and there is considerable potential for its development as an insect repellent. Traditionally, Akha people plant it in swidden fields, but there are few swidden fields in China now. Therefore, the first question this study aims to answer is as follows: how is fleagrass planted and utilized now? At present, fleagrass is only reported to be used by Akha people in Mengla. We also try to understand the following questions: Is fleagrass used in nearby area? If so, how is fleagrass used in nearby area? Furthermore, why is fleagrass used in that way? METHODS:From August 2016 to July 2018, field surveys were conducted six times. The ethnobotanical and ethnopharmacological uses of A. buchneroides in 13 Akha villages were investigated by means of semi-structured interviews. We assessed the responses of a total of 64 interviewees (32 men and 32 women; mean age, 58.6) from the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, southwest China, and from Phongsaly Province, Laos. To explain the bases for the ethnobotanical uses of fleagrass, we used Google Scholar, Web of Science, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure to review the bioactivities of the chemical constituents of A. buchneroides. RESULTS:With the vanishing of swidden agriculture and the development of modern products, fleagrass cultivation is disappearing in China. However, most Akha people in Xishuangbanna still remember and yearn for its traditional uses, and Akha people in a nearby area (northern Laos) continue to plant and utilize it. We documented ten uses of A. buchneroides within five discrete categories. The whole plant of fleagrass has a distinct strong aroma, of which Akha villagers are particularly fond. Akha villagers mostly use this aromatic property as a decoration, perfume, and insect repellent. A. buchneroides is also used as a condiment and for medicinal and ritual purposes, including its use as a cure for insect bites, headaches, influenza, and diarrhoea, and as a part of pray ritual for a bumper harvest. From our literature review, we identified many major chemical compounds contained in the essential oil of A. buchneroides, including thymol, carvacrol, 3-carene, and p-cymene, which have insecticidal or insect-repellent, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory properties. CONCLUSION:Fleagrass is an aromatic plant that is widely used by Aka people. Its chemical composition also has a variety of biological activities. With the vanishing of swidden agriculture and the development of modern products, fleagrass utilization in China is disappearing and its cultural importance is reduced. However, its economic and medicinal value is assignable.">

Therefore, epidermal barriers are crucial for providing protection, safeguarding health, and regulating water balance by maintaining skin homeostasis. Disruption of the epidermal barrier allows external substances and stimuli to invade or stimulate the epidermal cells, leading to the elicitation of skin inflammation. The major components of the epidermal barrier are the stratum corneum (SC) and tight junctions (TJs). The presence of zinc in the epidermis promotes epidermal homeostasis; hence, this study reviewed the role of zinc in the formation and function of the SC and TJs. Langerhans cells (LCs) are one of the antigen-presenting cells found in the epidermis. They form TJs with adjacent keratinocytes (KCs), capture external antigens, and induce antigen-specific immune reactions. Thus, the function of zinc in LCs was examined in this review. We also summarized the general knowledge of zinc and zinc transporters in the epidermis with updated findings.">

        <span class="abst" title="Contact dermatitis produces an inflammatory reaction primarily via stimulation of keratinocytes and cells of the immune system, which promote the release of cytokines, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and other chemical mediators. Eugenol (EUG, phenylpropanoid of essential oils) has attracted attention due to its anti-inflammatory properties, as well as antioxidant effect. On the other hand, it is volatile and insoluble and is a skin irritant. In this case, nanostructured systems have been successfully employed as a drug carrier for skin diseases since they improve both biological and pharmaceutical properties of active compounds. The cytotoxic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects of EUG were assessed in human neutrophils and keratinocytes. Additionally, polymeric nanocarries (NCEUG) were prepared to improve the chemical and irritant characteristics of EUG. EUG presented apparent safety and antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects on human neutrophils, but presented cytotoxic effects on keratinocytes. However, the nanocapsules were able to reduce its cytotoxicity. An in vivo experiment of irritant contact dermatitis (ICD) in mice induced by TPA showed that NCEUG reduced significantly the ear edema in mice when compared to the EUG solution, as well as the leukocyte infiltration and IL-6 level, possibly due to better skin permeation and irritancy blockage. These findings suggest that EUG is a promising bioactive molecule, and its nanoencapsulation seems to be an interesting approach for the treatment of ICD.">

Its treatment consists of the administration of topical or systemic antifungal agents, which may compromise the patient compliance due to its side effects, highlighting the need for alternative treatments. In this scenario, bullfrog oil, an animal oil composed of a pool of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, is introduced as a potential antifungal raw material. Thus, the aim of this work was to produce a mucoadhesive emulsified system able to deliver the bullfrog oil in the buccal cavity to treat the OC. The emulsion was produced and characterized by visual inspection, droplet size, polydispersity index (PdI), and zeta potential over the course of 60 days. In addition, its mucoadhesive ability was evaluated using an in vitro mucin model. The antifungal activity, evaluated by the broth microdilution assay and the biocompatibility, performed against human erythrocytes, were also carried out. The emulsion showed a droplet size of 320.79 ± 35.60 nm, a PdI of 0.49 ± 0.08, and a zeta potential of -38.53 ± 6.23 mV, with no significant changes over 60 days. The mucoadhesive properties of the system was improved by the use of pharmaceutical excipients. The antifungal activity showed that the bullfrog oil and the emulsion were able to inhibit the growth of different Candida species. Furthermore, the emulsion showed no significant hemolytic effect. Overall, the system showed suitable physicochemical characteristics and biocompatibility, with substantial in vitro antifungal activity, suggesting that this system can be further investigated for OC treatment.">

In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of MMB as a novel JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor in DNCB-induced AD mice and TSLP-activated dendritic cells. Our data showed that topical application of MMB reduced the skin severity scores and total serum IgE levels, and alleviated the histological indexes including epidermal thickness measurement and mast cell number. Also, it was demonstrated that MMB down-regulated the mRNA expression of IL-4, IL-5, IFN-γ and TSLP, and inhibited the phosphorylation of STAT1, STAT3 and STAT5 in skin lesions. Moreover, MMB reduced the expression of CD80, CD86, MHCII and mRNA of OX40L in TSLP-activated dendritic cells. In general, our study suggests that MMB can improve the symptoms of AD and topical application of MMB can become a promising new therapy strategy for AD.">

        <span class="abst" title="Virgin coconut oil (VCO) has been traditionally used as moisturizer since centuries by people in the tropical region. Clinical studies have revealed that VCO improves the symptoms of skin disorders by moisturizing and soothing the skin. However, the mechanistic action of VCO and its benefits on skin has not been elucidated in vitro. The cytotoxicity (CTC50) of VCO was 706.53 ± 2.1 and 787.15 ± 1.1 μg/mL in THP-1 (Human monocytes) and HaCaT (Human keratinocytes) cells respectively. VCO inhibited TNF-α (62.34 ± 3.2 %), IFN-γ (42.66 ± 2.9 %), IL-6 (52.07 ± 2.0 %), IL-8 (53.98 ± 1.8 %) and IL-5 (51.57 ± 2.6 %) respectively in THP-1 cells. Involucrin (INV) and filaggrin (FLG) content increased by 47.53 ± 2.1 % and 40.45 ± 1.2 % respectively in HaCaT cells. VCO increased the expression of Aquaporin-3 (AQP3), involucrin (INV) and filaggrin (FLG) and showed moderate UV protection in HaCaT cells. In vitro skin irritation studies in Reconstructed human epidermis (RHE) and NIH3T3 cells showed that VCO is a non skin irritant (IC50 &gt; 1000 μg/mL) and non phototoxic (PIF &lt; 2). Our study demonstrated the anti inflammatory activity of VCO by suppressing inflammatory markers and protecting the skin by enhancing skin barrier function. This is the first report on anti-inflammatory and skin protective benefits of VCO in vitro. Overall, the results warrant the use of VCO in skin care formulations.">

        <span class="abst" title="Perilla frutescens (L.) Britt. (PF) is an annual herbal medicinal, aromatic, functional food, and ornamental plant that belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae. The origin of perilla traces back to East Asian countries (China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, and India), where it has been used as a valuable source of culinary and traditional medicinal uses. The leaves, seeds, and stems of P. frutescens are used for various therapeutic applications in folk medicine. In the absence of a comprehensive review regarding all aspects of perilla, this review aims to present an overview pertaining to the botanical drug, ethnobotany, phytochemistry, and biological activity. It was found that the taxonomic classification of perilla species is quite confused, and the number of species is vague. Perilla has traditionally been prescribed to treat depression-related disease, anxiety, asthma, chest stuffiness, vomiting, coughs, colds, flus, phlegm, tumors, allergies, intoxication, fever, headache, stuffy nose, constipation, abdominal pain, and indigestion, and acts as an analgesic, anti-abortive agent, and a sedative. Until now, 271 natural molecules have been identified in perilla organs including phenolic acids, flavonoids, essential oils, triterpenes, carotenoids, phytosterols, fatty acids, tocopherols, and policosanols. In addition to solvent extracts, these individual compounds (rosmarinic acid, perillaldehyde, luteolin, apigenin, tormentic acid, and isoegomaketone) have attracted researchers' interest for its pharmacological properties. Perilla showed various biological activities such as antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-allergic, antidepressant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and neuroprotection effects. Although the results are promising in preclinical studies (in vitro and in vivo), clinical studies are insufficient; therefore, further study needs to be done to validate its therapeutic effects and to ensure its safety and efficacy.">

        <span class="abst" title="An estimated 25%⁻32% of veterans of the 1991 Gulf War continue to experience multiple unexplained health problems known as Gulf War Illness (GWI). GWI encompasses chronic pain, musculoskeletal weakness, headache, fatigue, cognitive deficits, alterations in mood, and numerous multi-system complaints. Most potential exposures implicated in GWI were not well documented but included varying levels of several neurotoxicants as well as the anticholinergic drug pyridostigmine bromide (PB), which was routinely taken as prophylaxis against the nerve agent soman. While some veterans also took chloroquine as an antimalarial agent, the literature suggests an association between receipt of multiple vaccinations prior to or during the conflict (perhaps combined with other exposures), and GWI. In-theater exposures may account for any single individual veteran's ill health but many veterans of the same era who were not deployed overseas also suffer the same or similar symptoms. The features of GWI also overlap with those of fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome and multiple chemical sensitivity, in all of which liver dysfunction has been documented, suggesting a unifying hypothesis. It is proposed that multiple vaccinations, with concurrent or subsequent exposure to PB or additional chemical insults of a liver-damaging nature, plausibly explain the pathogenesis and the observed chronicity of GWI. The suggested mechanism for GWI is thus a chemically-induced impaired liver function, with the spillage of stored vitamin A compounds (&quot;retinoids&quot;) into the circulation in toxic concentrations, resulting in an endogenous chronic form of hypervitaminosis A. Implications of the hypothesis are briefly reviewed.">

Therefore, this study was carried out to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo preventive effects of a novel herbal formula made from the five plants (C2RLP) against atopic dermatitis in BALB/C mice. METHODS:Mice were allocated into five groups (n = 8) including, control (Normal, petrolatum, and betamethasone treated) and treatment groups (treated with 2.5 and 5% C2RLP ointment). Atopic lesion was induced by applying 1-Chloro-2, 4-dinitrobenzene to the dorsal thoracic area of mice. Macroscopical and histological evaluations were performed to determine the effects of treatment on the progress of the skin lesions. The effects of treatment on the production and release of interleukins, interferon -ϒ, nitrite, prostaglandin E2, thymus and activation-receptor chemokine, and β-hexosaminidase were evaluated and comparisons were made between groups. In addition, the chemical compounds present in C2RLP were identified by Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry. RESULTS:Topical application of C2RLP reduced the dermatitis score and suppressed histopathological changes in mice. Treatment significantly reduced (P &lt; 0.05) plasma IL-4 level, the production of nitrite, prostaglandin E2, and thymus and activation-receptor chemokine production. The lipopolysaccharide-induced iNOS-mRNA expression in RAW 264.7 cells was also suppressed by high concentrations of C2RLP. In addition, C2RLP showed an inhibitory effect against DPPH free radical (IC50 = 147.5 μg/ml) and β-hexosaminidase release (IC50 = 179.5 μg/ml). Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry analysis revealed the presence of various compounds, including loganin, ellagic acid, and kaempferol 3-glucoside. CONCLUSION:Down-regulation of T- helper 2 cellular responses and suppression of inflammatory mediators contributed to the protective effects of C2RLP from atopic dermatitis in BALB/C mice.">

This study sets out to determine the antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity of 23 essential oils combined with six known carrier oils. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry/flame ionization detector (GC-MS/FID) was used to characterize the methyl esters of the carrier oils. The antimicrobial activity of the carrier oils alone and in combination with the essential oils was investigated using the broth microdilution assay against 11 skin pathogens and the cytotoxicity was determined using the brine shrimp lethality assay. The interactive profiles of the combinations for both antimicrobial activity and the cytotoxicity were analysed and calculated using the fractional inhibitory concentration index (ΣFIC). The carrier oils demonstrated no antimicrobial antagonism when combined with the essential oils and the overall cytotoxicity of the majority of the combinations was decreased. The carrier oils that could be identified as enhancing the antimicrobial activity and decreasing the cytotoxicity were Aloe vera Mill. and Simmondsia chinensis C.K.Schneid (Jojoba oil), with an overall reduction in essential oil cytotoxicity of 87.5% at 24 hrs and 85% at 48 hrs by A. vera. Five of the essential oils (when diluted in A. vera and S. chinensis carrier oils) demonstrated enhanced antimicrobial activity against pathogens such as Brevibacterium epidermidis, B. linens, and P. aeruginosa with MIC values ranging from 0.09 to 0.50 mg/mL (and ΣFIC 0.14-0.39). The study could conclude that the carrier oils are complementary to essential oil formulations, mostly reducing cytotoxicity and in some cases enhancing the antimicrobial activity.">

Medicinal plants have been for centuries a promising alternative as sources of new drugs. The objective of this work was to evaluate the chemical composition, antimicrobial and antileishmanial activities of Cinnamomum zeylanicum, Origanum vulgare, and Curcuma longa essential oils. Chemical analysis was performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Antimicrobial activity was performed by disk diffusion and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) test. Antileishmanial activity was performed against antipromastigote and intracellular amastigote of Leishmania amazonensis. Cytotoxic and nitrite production were realized in BALB/c peritoneal macrophages. The major compounds of the essential oils were cinnamic aldehyde (46.30%) in C. zeylanicum, cis-p-menth-2-en-1-ol (33.88%) and linalyl acetate (13.90%) in O. vulgare, and turmerone (55.43%) in C. longa. The MIC showed significant antimicrobial activity of C. longa essential oil against S. aureus (83.3 ± 14.43 µg/mL). Antipromastigote activity showed IC50 values &gt;500 µg/mL to C. zeylanicum, 308.4 ± 1.402 µg/mL to O. vulgare, and 405.5 ± 1.119 µg/mL to C. longa essential oil. Activity against intracellular amastigote of L. amazonensis showed IC50 of 63.3 ± 1.369 µg/mL and cytotoxic was not observed, resulting in selectivity index higher than 15.79 to parasite. C. longa essential oil decreased nitrite production in peritoneal macrophages, but not in Leishmania-infected cells. The chemical composition of the three essential oils is directly associated to its potential biological action, as the antimicrobial activity. C. longa presented a potent antileishmanial activity against promastigote and intracellular amastigote of L. amazonensis, although this activity is not linked to nitric oxide, since C. longa essential oil inhibits its production.">

Although current methods of treatment for cervical cancer can ablate lesions, preventing metastatic disseminations and excessive tissue injuries still remains a major concern. Hence, development of a safer and more efficient treatment modality is of vital importance. Natural products from plants are one of the principal sources of precursors to lead compounds with direct pharmaceutical application across all disease classes. One of these plants is Ficus carica, whose fruit latex, when applied on HPV-induced skin warts, has shown potential as a possible cure for this virus related lesions. This study explores the in vitro biological activities of fig latex and elucidates its possible mechanisms of action on cervical cancer cell lines CaSki and HeLa positive for HPV type 16 and 18, respectively. Our data shows that fig latex inhibits properties that are associated with HPV-positive cervical cancer transformed cells such as rapid growth and invasion and substantially downregulated the expression of p16 and HPV onco-proteins E6, E7. These findings suggest Ficus carica latex has the potential to be used in the development of therapeutic modalities for the possible treatment, cure and prevention of HPV related cervical cancer.">

They are responsible for numerous cellular functions, such as signaling, cell membrane fluidity, and structural maintenance. They also regulate the nervous system, blood pressure, hematic clotting, glucose tolerance, and inflammatory processes, which may be useful in all inflammatory conditions. Animal models and cell-based models show that n-3 PUFAs can influence skeletal muscle metabolism. Furthermore, recent human studies demonstrate that they can influence not only the exercise and the metabolic response of skeletal muscle, but also the functional response for a period of exercise training. In addition, their potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity may provide health benefits and performance improvement especially in those who practice physical activity, due to their increased reactive oxygen production. This review highlights the importance of n-3 PUFAs in our diet, which focuses on their potential healthy effects in sport.">

Furthermore, P. acnes promotes inflammation by inducing IL-6 production and oxidative stress. The aim of this study was to assess the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antibacterial potential of a hop-CO₂-extract with 50% humulone and lupulone. The susceptibility of P. acnes and S. aureus to the hop extract was tested by using the broth microdilution technique. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for P. acnes and S. aureus were 3.1 and 9.4 µg/mL, respectively. In addition, the hop extract showed an antioxidative effect with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 29.43 µg/mL as well as additional anti-inflammatory effects by reducing the IL-6 expression (IC50: 0.8 µg/mL). In addition, a gel formulation with 0.3% hop extract (w/w) had antibacterial activity against P. acnes and S. aureus (inhibition zone value: 5.5 mm and 3 mm, respectively) which was significantly superior to the placebo gel. The positive control (a gel with the antibiotic clindamycin) showed an inhibition zone of 9 mm. Due to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antibacterial effects hop extract might be a treatment option for acne-prone skin.">

The simple way to stop the transmission is to control the vector by using synthetic chemicals. However, herbal essential oils have biological properties, such as a larvicidal effect and are ecofriendly to use. In this study, we investigated the larvicidal activity of Curcuma zedoaria essential oil (ZEO) and biosynthesized silver nanoparticles using this essential oil (ZEO-AgNPs). The larvicidal activity against both insecticide-susceptible and -resistant strains of Cx. quinquefasciatus larvae of ZEO were investigated and compared with ZEO-AgNPs. The ZEO-AgNPs showed the utmost toxicity against both strains of Cx. quinquefasciatus. After 24 h of exposure, LC50 and LC99 of ZEO against susceptible strain were 36.32 and 85.11 ppm, respectively. While LC50 and LC99 of ZEO against the resistant strain were 37.29 and 76.79 ppm, respectively. Whereas ZEO-AgNPs offered complete larval mortality within 24 h of exposure, LC50 and LC99 of ZEO-AgNPs against the susceptible strain, were 0.57 and 8.54 ppm, respectively. For the resistant strain, LC50 and LC99 values were 0.64 and 8.88 ppm, respectively. The potency in killing Cx. quinquefasciatus and stability of ZEO-AgNPs have made this product a good candidate for the development of novel natural larvicides.">

Drug therapies and complementary medicine have been used to treat dysmenorrhea. The aim of this study was to investigate and offer an updated perspective on the treatments for dysmenorrhea. METHODS:The present study was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA checklist for systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The required information was collected based on searches for the following keywords: treatment, primary dysmenorrhea, medicinal plants, chemical drugs, and herbs. Searches were performed on databases Pubmed, Web of Sciences, Scopus, Iran medex, and SID by March 2018 to find literature in the English and Persian languages on this subject without a time limit. RESULTS:This review included 17 papers, 10 of which on complementary medicine, three on drug therapies, and four on acupuncture and acupressure. The largest and smallest samples had 303 and 24 patients, respectively. Length of treatment ranged from one to six months and the measures most commonly used in the studies were the visual analogue scale and clinical efficacy. Reported complications included gastrointestinal events, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and liver and kidney disorders. CONCLUSION:Medicinal plants, drugs, and acupressure seem to suppress pain by reducing the level of prostaglandins, mediating nitric oxide, increasing beta-endorphin levels, blocking the calcium channel, and enhancing circulatory flow through the uterine pathway. Further trials are required to confirm the benefits of the procedures described and ensure the absence of complications.">

ACD is a skin inflammatory reaction characterized by modifications such as spongiosis, exocytosis and acanthosis. The aim of this study is to characterize the expression and the role of IL-20-related cytokines, including IL-19, IL-20, IL-22 and IL-24, in ACD. The expression of IL19, IL20, IL22 and IL24 is increased in affected skin from PPD allergic patients compared with uninvolved skin. In addition, the expression of these cytokines positively correlates with clinical symptoms. To assess their role in ACD, we set up a mouse model of PPD-induced allergic contact dermatitis and we showed that, in contrast to Il22-deficient mice, Il22ra1-, Il20rb- and Il24-deficient mice are partially protected against development of PPD-induced contact hypersensitivity. These mice have decreased ear thickening and less acanthosis compared with WT mice after PPD treatment. In addition, the absence of IL-22R, IL-20R2 or IL-24 affects the recruitment of neutrophils into the skin but not the total IgE production. Taken together, these results demonstrate the implication of IL-24 via the IL-20R type II receptor in the inflammatory process of ACD.">

        <span class="abst" title="Acne vulgaris is the most common dermatological disorder worldwide. It is a multifactorial disease that involves increased sebum production, hyperkeratinization of the pilosebaceous unit, Propionibacterium acnes (Cutibacterium acnes) colonization, and inflammation. The human skin microbiome hosts a wide variety of microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi. A delicate balance of these microorganisms is essential for the barrier function of the skin. Propionibacterium acnes represents nearly 90% of the human skin microbiome of healthy adults. Acne is a chronic recurrent disease that requires long-lasting treatment, which has led to the emergence of antibiotic resistance. New alternatives to traditional therapy are emerging, including antimicrobial peptides, natural engineered antibodies, and bacteriophages. Bacteriophages have been shown to play a role in human skin health and disease. There is evidence supporting phage therapy in many types of skin infections. P. acnes bacteriophages have been isolated and characterized. However, only a few in vitro studies have tested the ability of bacteriophages to kill P. acnes. Furthermore, there is no evidence on bacteriophage therapy in the treatment of acne in humans. In this review, we summarize the most recent evidence regarding P. acnes bacteriophages and the potential role of these bacteriophages in the treatment of acne. Further research on this field will provide the evidence to use phage therapy to decrease rates of antibiotic resistance and restore antibiotic susceptibility of P. acnes.">

This region has native fruit trees in which functional properties are reported as antioxidant and antiproliferative characteristics. Amazon plants offer a great therapeutic potential attributed to the content of bioactive phytochemicals. The aim of this mini review is to examine the state of the art of the main bioactive components of the most studied Amazonian plants. Among the main functional compounds reported were phenolic compounds, unsaturated fatty acids, carotenoids, phytosterols, and tocopherols, with flavonoids and carotenoids being the groups of greatest interest. The main beneficial effect reported has been the antioxidant effect, evaluated in most of the fruits investigated; other reported functional properties were antimicrobial, antimutagenic, antigenotoxic, analgesic, immunomodulatory, anticancer, bronchodilator, antiproliferative, and anti-inflammatory, including hypercholesterolemic effects, leishmanicidal activity, induction of apoptosis, protective action against diabetes, gastroprotective activity, and antidepressant effects.">

        <span class="abst" title="Allergic conjunctivitis (AC) is one of the most common ocular surface diseases in the world. In AC, T helper type 2 (Th2) immune responses play central roles in orchestrating inflammatory responses. However, the roles of lipid mediators in the onset and progression of AC remain to be fully explored. Although previous reports have shown the beneficial effects of supplementation of ω-3 fatty acids in asthma or atopic dermatitis, the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. In this study, a diet rich in ω-3 fatty acids alleviated AC symptoms in both early and late phases without affecting Th2 immune responses, but rather by altering the lipid mediator profiles. The ω-3 fatty acids completely suppressed scratching behavior toward the eyes, an allergic reaction provoked by itch. Although total serum IgE levels and the expression levels of Th2 cytokines and chemokines in the conjunctiva were not altered by ω-3 fatty acids, eosinophil infiltration into the conjunctiva was dramatically suppressed. The levels of ω-6-derived proinflammatory lipid mediators, including those with chemoattractant properties for eosinophils, were markedly reduced in the conjunctivae of ω-3 diet-fed mice. Dietary ω-3 fatty acids can alleviate a variety of symptoms of AC by altering the lipid mediator profile.-Hirakata, T., Lee, H.-C., Ohba, M., Saeki, K., Okuno, T., Murakami, A., Matsuda, A., Yokomizo, T.

Phytochemical contents, along with antiradical scavenging potential of the related methanol extracts were separately assessed. The spring and autumn samples (fresh and dried) yielded more essential oil than the other samples. Forty-one compounds were identified totally in the oils and the major constituents characterized were β-caryophyllene, sabinene, and caryophyllene oxide. The extracts obtained from winter and summer plants possessed the highest total phenolics. The maximum amount of total flavonoid content was measured in winter (December and January), whereas the minimum one was observed in spring (March). The summer and winter samples showed the highest and lowest content of flavones and flavanols, respectively, whereas the anthocyanin content was higher in winter than in summer. Moreover, antiradical activity of the extracts in summer and winter samples was higher than in other seasons. Overall, this study can provide useful information regarding the best harvest period of Arabian lilac to yield the desired compounds for application in phytopharmaceutical and food industries.">

        <span class="abst" title="Laurel, Laurus nobilis L. is an evergreen plant belonging to the Lauraceae family, native to Southern Europe and the Mediterranean area. This is the first report on the composition and bioactivity of laurel essential oil (EO) from Bulgaria. The oil yield was 0.78%, 0.80%, and 3.25% in the fruits, twigs, and leaves, respectively. The main constituents in the fruit EO were 1,8-cineole (33.3%), α-terpinyl acetate (10.3%), α-pinene (11.0%), β-elemene (7.5%), sabinene (6.3%), β-phellandrene (5.2%), bornyl acetate (4.4%), and camphene (4.3%); those in the twig EO were 1,8-cineole (48.5%), α-terpinyl acetate (13.1%), methyl eugenol (6.6%), β-linalool (3.8%), β-pinene (3.4%), sabinene (3.3%) and terpinene-4-ol (3.3%); and the ones in the leaf EO were 1,8-cineole (41.0%), α-terpinyl acetate (14.4%), sabinene (8.8%), methyl eugenole (6.0%), β-linalool (4.9%), and α-terpineol (3.1%). The antibacterial and antifungal properties of laurel EOs were examined according to the agar well diffusion method. The leaf EO showed antibacterial and antifungal activities against almost all strains of the microorganisms tested, whereas the twig EO was only able to inhibit Staphylococcus aureus. Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027 and Escherichia coli ATCC 8739 were the bacterial strains that showed the highest resistance to the laurel EO. The results can benefit the EO industry and biopesticide development.">

        <span class="abst" title="Skin serves as the first protective line and barrier of the body. Like many other organs, skin can be affected by several disorders in response to external factors such as pathogens, ultraviolet light, and pollution, as well as endogenous alterations related to aging and/or oxidative stress disturbance. Researchers have reported new insights into how skin cells are altered in response to caloric restriction diets in mammals. One of the most well-known caloric restriction diets is the Ramadan intermittent fasting, which is a radical change in the diet plan of practitioners for the period of one lunar month. Ramadan fasting represents the fourth of the five pillars of the Islamic creed. Even though infirm individuals are waived to take part in this religious duty, patients with various health problems, including those with different skin disorders, might choose to share this event with peers and family members. No standardized protocols or guidelines exist, however, to advise their physicians on the proper management of their patients' condition during fasting. With an increasing Muslim population living in Western countries, this topic has started to draw substantial attention, not only of Middle-Eastern physicians, but also of clinicians in the West. For this purpose, we carried out a comprehensive overview on the topic. Our main findings are that: (1) there is a strong need for evidence-based suggestions and guidance. Literature on the impact of the Ramadan fasting, as well as of other kinds of fasting, on skin diseases is scarce and of poor quality, as well as the information available from the Internet; (2) patients willing to fast should be advised about the importance of taking proper treatments or consider alternative options including administration of trans-dermal/topical drugs, as they are permitted during daylight hours. Further, non-compliance has important, clinical and economic implications for an effective patient management.">

ATRA is widely used in the treatment of skin diseases, but results in irritation, dryness and peeling, possibly due to an impaired skin barrier, although the exact mechanisms are unclear. The present study established an ATRA‑associated dermatitis mouse model (n=32) in order to examine the molecular mechanisms of skin barrier impairment by ATRA. Changes in epidermal morphology and structure were observed using histological examination and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Gene expression was analyzed by microarray chip assay. Histology and TEM demonstrated pronounced epidermal hyperproliferation and parakeratosis upon ATRA application. The stratum corneum layer displayed abnormal lipid droplets and cell‑cell junctions, suggesting alterations in lipid metabolism and dysfunctional cell junctions. Gene expression profiling revealed that factors associated with epidermal barrier function were differentially expressed by ATRA, including those associated with tight junctions (TJs), cornified envelopes, lipids, proteases, protease inhibitors and transcription factors. In the mouse epidermis, Claudin‑1 and ‑4 are proteins involved in TJs and have key roles in epidermal barrier function. ATRA reduced the expression and altered the localization of Claudin‑1 in HaCaT immortalized keratinocytes and the mouse epidermis, which likely leads to the disruption of the epidermal barrier. By contrast, Claudin‑4 was upregulated in HaCaT cells and the mouse epidermis following treatment with ATRA. In conclusion, ATRA exerts a dual effect on epidermal barrier genes: It downregulates the expression of Claudin‑1 and upregulates the expression of Claudin‑4. Claudin‑4 upregulation may be a compensatory response for the disrupted barrier function caused by Claudin‑1 downregulation.">

With a distinct mode of antibacterial activity, broad spectrum of action, and diversity of available chemistries, plant secondary metabolites present an attractive alternative to conventional antibiotics. However, their conversion from liquid to solid phase without a significant loss of activity is not trivial. Using selected examples, this article shows how plasma techniques provide a sufficiently flexible and chemically reactive environment to enable the synthesis of biologically-active polymer coatings from volatile renewable resources.">

Several studies have demonstrated a great interest among men and women for effective, reversible, and safe male contraceptive methods. Over the years, numerous studies have been performed to develop male hormonal and nonhormonal safe and effective contraceptives. A variety of new molecules are under development as oral or transdermal hormonal contraceptives for men demonstrating few side effects.

The misuse of this natural product in higher doses may lead to fever, inflammation, and liver and kidney problems. In this study, we performed the acute and subacute toxicity analysis of MEO in mice model after subcutaneous injection and evaluated the safe dose to prevent the possible risk and side effects. Initially (first phase study) higher dose of MEO (20, 40, and 80 μL) was injected, and later in the second phase study lower dose of MEO (1, 5, and 10 μL) was injected for three days in each group of mice. Blood samples were taken for the investigation of hematological parameters and activity of various enzymes. The liver, kidney, spleen, lungs, and heart were excised for histological study. The body weight and skin abnormalities were also evaluated. In the first phase study, the mice showed granuloma formation at the site of injection. The liver showed dilated sinusoids and enlarged central vein. In the spleen the distinction between red and white pulp was lost. The kidney showed the degeneration of glomerulus. The enzyme activity and body weight were also decreased by the higher dose. The WBC count also increased nearly by twofold. Pruritus and self-trauma were also evident. Later in the second phase study, the skin abnormalities (granuloma) and damage in the structure of tissue (in liver, spleen, and kidney) were absent along with no change in enzyme levels, blood parameters, and body weight compared to the control. The MEO was toxic to liver, spleen, and kidney in the higher doses. The safe volume of MEO useful for various studies in mice was evaluated. The safe use of MEO should be assured, it should not be misused, being considered as a natural remedy, and there should be awareness of its toxicity and side effects.">

In the present study, the therapeutic potential of paeonol on atopic dermatitis (AD) was investigated using animal and cell experiments. AD‑like lesions were induced by repeated application of 1‑chloro‑2,4‑dinitrobenzene (DNCB) to the shaved dorsal skin of BALB/c mice, and P815 cells were used for in vitro assays. The skin lesions, serum and spleens of the mice were analyzed using lesion severity scoring, histological analysis, flow cytometry, reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction, western blotting and ELISA, in order to investigate the anti‑AD effects of paeonol. In addition, western blotting and ELISA were conducted for in vitro analysis of P815 cells. The results demonstrated that oral administration of paeonol inhibited the development of DNCB‑induced AD‑like lesions in the BALB/c mice by reducing severity of the lesions, epidermal thickness and mast cell infiltration; this was accompanied by reduced levels of immunoglobulin E and inflammatory cytokines [interleukin (IL)‑4, histamine, IL‑13, IL‑31 and thymic stromal lymphopoietin], along with regulation of the T helper (Th) cell subset (Th1/Th2) ratio. Application of paeonol also reduced the protein expression levels of phosphorylated (p)‑p38 and p‑extracellular signal‑regulated kinase (ERK) in skin lesions. In vitro, paeonol reduced the expression levels of tumor necrosis factor‑α and histamine in P815 cells, and inhibited p38/ERK/mitogen‑activated protein kinase signaling. The present findings indicated that paeonol may relieve dermatitis by acting on cluster of differentiation 4+ T and mast cells; therefore, paeonol may represent a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of allergic inflammatory conditions via immunoregulation.">

The ability of broiler chicks to spontaneously drink essential oils (EO) to mitigate the effects of a negative postnatal experience was tested. Chicks were placed in the rearing facility either immediately (C group), or after a 24 h-delay period (D group) to mimic a delay in transportation possible under commercial conditions. In experiment 1, each group had access to either water only or to water and one EO (cardamom, marjoram, or verbena) from D1 to D13. Verbena EO intake was higher in the D group than in the C group from D1 to D6 and cardamom EO intake was lower in the D group than in the C group from D6 to D13. In experiment 2, half of the groups had access to water only and the other half had both water and the three EO simultaneously. Chicks from D and C groups chose the EO similarly except for cardamom EO with a lower intake being observed in the D than in the C group from D6 to D12. The delayed placement of the D group reduced chicken growth until 34 days of age and temporarily increased the feed conversion ratio, but did not affect their welfare or the prevalence of health disorders. The EO intake did not mitigate the growth reduction in D group chicks, but did mitigate the reduced Pectoralis major muscle yield. In conclusion, chicks were able to make spontaneous choices regarding EO intake according to their postnatal experience when EO were presented individually, but not when presented simultaneously as in our experimental design. The EO intake only partially mitigated the decrease in chicken performance after the negative postnatal experience.">

There is evidence that impaired skin barrier function increases the risk of allergic sensitisation, atopic dermatitis (AD) and food allergy. We hypothesise that regular prophylactic use of emollients, particularly those that are designed to improve skin barrier structure and function, will help prevent these conditions. With the aim of determining if application of a ceramide-dominant emollient two times per day reduces the risk of AD and food allergy, we have commenced a multicentre phase III, outcome assessor blinded, randomised controlled trial of this emollient applied from birth to 6 months. METHODS AND ANALYSIS:Infants (n=760) with a family history of allergic disease will be recruited from maternity hospitals in Melbourne. The primary outcomes are as follows: the presence of AD, assessed using the UK Working Party criteria, and food allergy using food challenge, in the first 12 months of life as assessed by a blinded study outcome assessor. Secondary outcomes are as follows: food sensitisation (skin prick test), skin barrier function, AD severity, the presence of new onset AD after treatment cessation (between 6 and 12 months) and the presence of parent reported AD/eczema. Recruitment commenced in March 2018. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION:The PEBBLES Study is approved by the Human Research Ethics Committees of the Royal Children's Hospital (RCH) (#37090A) and the Mercy Hospital for Women (2018-008). Parents or guardians will provide written informed consent. Outcomes will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and presented at scientific conferences.

Due to the high potential for skin exposure to SiNPs, research into the effect of topical exposure on both healthy and inflammatory skin models is warranted. While we observe only minimal effects of SiNPs on healthy mouse skin, there is an immunomodulatory effect of these NPs in a model of allergic contact dermatitis. The effect appears to be mediated partly by keratinocytes and results in decreases in epidermal hyperplasia, inflammatory cytokine release, immune cell infiltration, and a subsequent reduction in skin swelling. Additional research is required to further our mechanistic understanding and to validate the extent of this immunomodulatory effect in human subjects in order to assess the potential prophylactic use of SiNPs for treating allergic skin conditions.">

        <span class="abst" title="Objectives:Leishmaniasis is one of the main health problems in developing countries, caused by intracellular protozoan parasites of the Leishmania genus. Although research has been successful in discovering vaccines and anti-parasitic drugs like antimony compounds, their side effects like high toxicity, prolonged regeneration, etc., have raised the replacement importance of natural products with antioxidant and antibacterial properties. It can be said that an appropriate alternative to this is the ozonated olive oil. Ozone by introducing O2 in involved tissues and bloodstream could degrade parasite amastigotes and lead to cleared leishmaniasis infections. So, the present study aimed to evaluate the effect of ozonated olive oil in Iranian leishmaniasis patients compared to glucantime, a choice drug for the treatment of Leishmaniasis. Materials and Methods:Thirty patients with confirmed leishmaniasis lesions were included and divided into two groups, 15 cases as control and 15 cases as test with lesions of 30-50 mm2 in diameter. The control group received glucantime intralesionally and the test group ozonated olive oil plus glucantime, 2 times daily. Results:The mean of lesion size was (50.94±33.20) before and (15±14.34) after treatment in control (P&lt;0.00) and (50.88±31.74) before and (9.93±14.18) after treatment in the test group (P&lt;0.00). Moreover, the mean course of therapy was 10.4(±1.84) weeks and 8.93(±2.15) weeks in control and test groups, respectively (P=0.636). Significant differences were reported in lesion size after treatment between the two groups (P&lt;0.00). Conclusion:Data suggested ozonated olive oil can have synergistic effects with glucantime in the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis.">

In this context, a constant demand for the research and development of products that prevent these features, has been noted in the field of cosmetics and dermatology. Thus, the objective of this study is to evaluate the cutaneous characteristics of oily skin due an excessive production of sebum through biophysical and skin imaging techniques. 19 participants with different skin types were selected and the following parameters were evaluated: pore count, determination of the number of sebaceous glands and amount of sebum in infundibulum, determination of cutaneous microrelief, count of comedones, evaluation of epidermis thickness, characterization of the cellular, and comedone size and its characteristics. These evaluations were done through biophysical and skin imaging techniques. The obtained results showed that different regions of the face presented different characteristics related to oiliness, quantity, and the appearance of pores and comedones. The malar region had a lower epidermis thickness and a larger number of large pores. Moreover, in this region excessive sebum production, which can be related to pores, not comedones, was noted. The nose region presented higher sebum content in the infundibulum and lower active sebaceous glands, showing a higher activity of sebaceous production in this region. The chin region presented a positive correlation between the sebum content, roughness parameter and the number of pores and comedones. As different skin properties are related and influence the appearance of undesirable clinical signs, we identified the need for a multifactorial approach for the effective treatment of oily skin. The rational development of multifunctional cosmetic products that promote the control of oily skin, that regulate the keratinization process, improve the microrelief and leads to a better epidermis and dermis structure, will not only improve oily skin conditions but will also allow for the reduction or disappearance of clinical signs that result from excessive oiliness, all of which causes concern and results in a relentless search for cosmetic and dermatological products that address the unaesthetic nature of these conditions.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Polyunsaturated fatty acids such as linoleic acid (LA) and α-linolenic acid (ALA) are abundant in vegetable oils and are important for human health. In the body, LA and ALA are respectively converted to the omega-6 fatty acid γ-linolenic acid (GLA) and the omega-3 fatty acid stearidonic acid (SDA) by Δ6 desaturase (D6DES). Currently, dietary GLA and SDA are mainly obtained from marine organisms, but given their benefits to human health, many studies have aimed to enhance their accumulation in transgenic crops. Perilla frutescens (perilla) accumulates more ALA in its seed oil compared to other oilseed crops, making it a good candidate for the production of fatty acids via the fatty acid desaturase D6DES. RESULTS:In this study, we cloned the D6DES gene from Phytophthora citrophthora and confirmed its function in budding yeast. We then transformed the functional D6DES gene under the control of the seed-specific vicilin promoter into the perilla cultivar Yeobsil. The resulting transgenic perilla seeds accumulated significant levels of GLA and SDA, as well as putative C18:2Δ6,9 at minor levels. Developing seeds and leaves also accumulated GLA and SDA, although PcD6DES expression and GLA and SDA levels were much lower in leaves compared to developing seeds. GLA and SDA accumulated in both polar lipids and neutral lipids in mature perilla seeds expressing PcD6DES, especially in neutral lipids. Although the seed weight in PcD6DES perilla was 87-96% that of wild type, the total oil content per seed weight was similar between lines. The PcD6DES perilla plants contained very high content (over 45%) of both GLA and SDA in seed oil. CONCLUSIONS:Thus, PcD6DES perilla plants may represent a feasible alternative to traditional marine sources for the production of omega-3 oil capsules and to evening primrose seed oil for GLA as health food. In addition, these plants can be used to create other transgenic lines harboring additional genes to produce other desirable fish-oil like oils.">

At the apical end of Drosophila testis, self-renewal and differentiation of germline stem cells (GSCs) are tightly controlled by distinct somatic cells that comprise a specialised stem cell niche known as the hub. The hub maintains GSC homeostasis through adhesion and cell signaling. The Salvador/Warts/Hippo (SWH) pathway, which suppresses the transcriptional co-activator YAP/Yki via a kinase cascade, is a known regulator of stem cell proliferation and differentiation. Here, we show that increasing YAP/Yki expression in the germline, as well as reducing Warts levels, blocks the decrease of GSC numbers observed in aging flies, with only a small increase on their proliferation. An increased expression of YAP/Yki in the germline or a reduction in Warts levels also stymies an age-related reduction in hub cell number, suggesting a bilateral relationship between GSCs and the hub. Conversely, RNAi-based knockdown of YAP/Yki in the germline leads to a significant drop in hub cell number, further suggesting the existence of such a SC-to-niche relationship. All together, our data implicate the SWH pathway in Drosophila GSC maintenance and raise questions about its role in stem cell homeostasis in aging organisms.">

Construction of engineered oleaginous microbes have been attracting significant interest to produce DGLA because of its nutritional value and medicinal applications. Mucor circinelloides is a GLA producing filamentous fungus which can be a useful tool to produce DGLA. We have, therefore, overexpressed the D6E (GLELO) gene in this fungus to construct DGLA producing cell factory. RESULT:To produce DGLA in M. circinelloides, homologous overexpression of D6E (GLELO) gene was analyzed. When the gene was overexpressed in M. circinelloides CBS277.49, up to 5.72% DGLA was produced in this strain. CONCLUSION:To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the overexpression of D6E (GLELO) gene in M. circinelloides to construct DGLA producing cell factory. A new scope for further research has been established by this work for improved production of DGLA in this fungus, specifically in its high lipid-producing strain, WJ11.">

        <span class="abst" title="This work provides the ethnobotanical data concerning the traditional use of medicinal plants in Macedonia region (Northern Greece), which has, up to now, been poorly investigated. The aim of the present study was to collect, analyze, and evaluate information on the use of medicinal plants among different population groups living in Central Macedonia. The study was carried out in the area of two small cities, Edessa and Naoussa, and nearby villages. The ethnobotanical data were gathered through extensive and semistructured interviews. The informants belonged to different population groups living in the study areas and were involved, at least partially, in agriculture. Together with detailed reports on each species, data were also summarized by some indices, such as Fidelity Level (FL) and Informant Consensus Factor (Fic). A group of 96 informants was interviewed and 87 plant taxa with medicinal uses were cited. Medicinal plants are used to treat a wide range of diseases, in particular ailments of the respiratory tract and skin disorders. The importance of the traditional use of plants to cure and prevent common and some uncommon diseases had been highlighted. About 55% of medicinal plants mentioned by the informants had been previously reported to be sold in Thessaloniki herbal market as traditional remedies. Medicinal uses of some endemic taxa had been reported, e.g., Satureja montana subsp. macedonica, a member of the S. montana group restricted to Northern Central Greece, Origanum dictamnus, an endemic species of Crete, and six Balkan endemics, i.e., Achillea holosericea, Digitalis lanata, Helleborus odorus subsp. cyclophyllus, Sideritis scardica, Thymus sibthorpii, and Verbascum longifolium. Several differences in Traditional Ethnobotanical Knowledge (TEK) were observed in relation to social and cultural components of the population. Only 7 species (Crataegus monogyna, Hypericum perforatum, Matricaria chamomilla, Rosa canina, Sambucus nigra, Sideritis scardica, and Tilia platyphyllos) were commonly reported by all population groups, whereas 30 out of 87 taxa (34%) were exclusively mentioned by a single group. All groups are incorporated in the local society and do not identify themselves as members of different ethnic groups, although they try to preserve their distinctiveness by keeping their traditions and dialects. Nevertheless, our data show that the knowledge regarding the medicinal plant use was rarely accompanied by preservation of linguistic diversity concerning the plant names. This work contributes to improve the knowledge on the traditional use of plants in the folk medicine of a region like Central Macedonia where different population groups live together, partially maintaining their traditions. A part of data of this paper has been presented as posted at 112° Congress of Italian Botanical Society (IPSC), Parma 20-23 September 2017.">

Allergic and inflammatory diseases in the intestine occur as a result of dysregulation of immunological homeostasis mediated by intestinal immunity. Several lines of evidence suggest that gut environmental factors, including nutrition and intestinal bacteria, play important roles in controlling host immune responses and maintaining homeostasis. Among nutritional factors, ω3 and ω6 essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) profoundly influence the host immune system. Recent advances in lipidomics technology have led to the identification of lipid mediators derived from ω3- and ω6-PUFAs. In particular, lipid metabolites from ω3-PUFAs (e.g., eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid) have recently been shown to exert anti-allergic and anti-inflammatory responses; these metabolites include resolvins, protectins, and maresins. Furthermore, a new class of anti-allergic and anti-inflammatory lipid metabolites of 17,18-epoxyeicosatetraenoic acid has recently been identified in the control of allergic and inflammatory diseases in the gut and skin. Although these lipid metabolites were found to be endogenously generated in the host, accumulating evidence indicates that intestinal bacteria also participate in lipid metabolism and thus generate bioactive unique lipid mediators. In this review, we discuss the production machinery of lipid metabolites in the host and intestinal bacteria and the roles of these metabolites in the regulation of host immunity.">

In addition to being essential for morphological and functional development and for ocular integrity, vitamin A exerts systemic effects on several fetal organs and on the fetal skeleton. Vitamin A requirements during pregnancy are therefore greater. Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) remains the leading cause of preventable blindness in the world. VAD in pregnant women is a public health issue in most developing countries. In contrast, in some developed countries, excessive vitamin A intake during pregnancy can be a concern since, when in excess, this micronutrient may exert teratogenic effects in the first 60 days following conception. Routine prenatal vitamin A supplementation for the prevention of maternal and infant morbidity and mortality is not recommended; however, in regions where VAD is a public health issue, vitamin A supplementation is recommended to prevent night blindness. Given the importance of this topic and the lack of a complete, up-to-date review on vitamin A and pregnancy, an extensive review of the literature was conducted to identify conflicting or incomplete data on the topic as well as any gaps in existing data.">

In this study, we considered the DPs associated with these three skin health parameters in 84 healthy adults aged 19⁻37 years. Dietary intake was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and skin health parameters were determined on the forehead of each subject. Among the four DPs extracted from the FFQ, DP2, characterized by a high intake of cereals, potatoes and starch, saccharides and fish and shellfish, was negatively associated with skin hydration. DP3, characterized by a high intake of potatoes and starch, seeds and nuts, fruits and eggs, was positively associated with acidic skin pH only before adjusting for potential confounders. On the other hand, DP4, characterized by a low intake of beans, and a high intake of meats, dairy products and beverages and alcohol, was negatively associated with acidic skin pH and positively associated with sebum content. The data stratified by sex revealed a negative association between skin hydration and DP2 in males and a negative association between sebum content and DP3 and a positive association between sebum content and DP4 in females. In conclusion, we demonstrated that specific DPs were associated with sebum content, skin hydration and pH in healthy Korean adults and that those associations were affected by sex.">

A literature search showed that there is only one tool for evaluating rational prescribing for paediatric patients in hospital and outpatient settings. The Pediatrics: Omission of Prescriptions and Inappropriate Prescriptions (POPI) tool was developed in France and comprises 105 criteria. The aim of this study was to modify this tool to facilitate its use in paediatric practice in the United Kingdom (UK). POPI criteria were compared to relevant UK clinical guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, the Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network and the British National Formulary for Children. Where guidelines differed, criteria were modified to reflect UK guidance. If there were no relevant guidelines or directly contradictory guidelines, criteria were removed. Overall, no change was made to 49 criteria. There were 29 modified to concord with UK guidelines. Four criteria were reduced to two criteria due to being linked in single guidelines. Twenty-three criteria were omitted, due to the absence of relevant UK guidance or directly conflicting UK practice, including one entire clinical category (mosquitos). One category title was amended to parallel UK terminology. The modified POPI (UK) tool comprises of eighty criteria and is the first rational prescribing tool for the evaluation of prescribing for children in hospital and outpatient settings in the UK.">

There is a specific mention to PharmActa, a dedicated mobile app for personalized pharmaceutical care with information regarding drug⁻HMPs interactions. Several studies over the years have shown that for some HMPs, the potential to present clinically significant interactions is evident, especially for many of the top selling HMPs. Towards that, PharmActa presents how we can improve the way that information regarding potential drug⁻herb interactions can be disseminated to the public. The utilization of technologies focusing on medical information and context awareness introduce a new era in healthcare. The exploitation of eHealth tools and pervasive mobile monitoring technologies in the case of HMPs will allow the citizens to be informed and avoid potential drug⁻HMPs interactions enhancing the effectiveness and ensuring safety for HMPs.">

The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of PIM and PPO detected by POPI regarding prescriptions in hospital and for outpatients. The second objective is to determine the risk factors related to PIM and PPO. DESIGN:A retrospective, descriptive study was conducted in the emergency department (ED) and community pharmacy (CP) during 6 months. POPI was used to identify PIM and PPO. SETTING:Robert-Debré Hospital (France) and Albaret community pharmacy (Seine and Marne). PARTICIPANTS:Patients who were under 18 years old and who had one or more drugs prescribed were included. Exclusion criteria consisted of inaccessible medical records for patients consulted in ED and prescription without drugs for outpatients. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES:PIM and PPO rate and risk factors. RESULTS:At the ED, 18 562 prescriptions of 15 973 patients and 4780 prescriptions of 2225 patients at the CP were analysed. The PIM rate and PPO rate were, respectively, 2.9% and 2.3% at the ED and 12.3% and 6.1% at the CP. Respiratory and digestive diseases had the highest rate of PIM. CONCLUSION:This is the first study to assess the prevalence of PIM and PPO detected by POPI in a paediatric population. This study assessed PIMs or PPOs within a hospital and a community pharmacy. POPI could be used to improve drug use and patient care and to limit hospitalisation and adverse drug reaction. A prospective multicentric study should be conducted to evaluate the impact and benefit of implementing POPI in clinical practice.">

        <span class="abst" title="The Hippo pathway is an evolutionarily conserved regulator of organ size and tumorigenesis that negatively regulates cell growth and survival. Whether the Hippo pathway regulates cell metabolism is unknown. Here, we report that in the nucleus of hepatocytes, Yes-associated protein(YAP)-the terminal effector of the Hippo pathway-directly interacts with sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBP-1c and SREBP-2) on the promoters of the fatty acid synthase (FAS) and 30-hydroxylmethyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), thereby stimulating their transcription and promoting hepatocyte lipogenesis and cholesterol synthesis. In diet-induced diabetic mice, either Lats1 overexpression or YAP knockdown protects against hepatic steatosis and hyperlipidaemia through suppression of the interaction between YAP and SREBP-1c/SREBP-2. These results suggest that YAP is a nuclear co-factor of SREBPs and that the Hippo pathway negatively affects hepatocyte lipogenesis by inhibiting the function of YAP-SREBP complexes.">

Efficacy of oral fennel oil in management of dysmenorrhea, premenstrual syndrome, amenorrhea, menopause, lactation, and polycystic ovary syndrome were confirmed according to results of clinical studies. Results of clinical efficacy of fennel oil on menstrual bleeding is complicated, but results of one meta-analysis study revealed that fennel oil significantly increased means of bleeding in the first menstrual periodic cycle (P = 0.001), while fennel oil had no significant effect on bleeding in the second menstrual cycle (P = 0.67). Topical and vaginal fennel extract (5%) exhibited good efficacy in treatment of sexual function, vaginal atrophy, and hirsutism. Fennel had no effect on bone density, or body mass index of menopause women. Results of clinical studies introduce fennel as a valuable medicinal plant in management of women's ailments, but understanding the mechanism of action could be the subject of future studies.">

        <span class="abst" title="Ichthyoses represent a heterogeneous group of hereditary cornification disorders characterized by generalized scaling of the skin. An autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI) has been described in American Bulldogs and is caused by a variant in the NIPAL4 gene encoding for the ICHTHYIN protein. So far, this variant has not been described in other breeds. A 1.5-year-old female pedigreed American Bully was referred for generalized scaling and bad coat quality since adoption at 8 weeks of age. Clinical examination, cytological and histopathological examination, and DNA testing were performed. Clinical examination revealed a generalized scaling; cytological evaluation using impression with acetate tapes showed a secondary Malassezia dermatitis. Histopathological examination revealed a moderate to marked, diffuse, compact orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis with the formation of large scales. Few Malassezia were observed in the stratum corneum associated with minimal mixed perivascular inflammation and moderate epidermal hyperplasia. DNA testing of the dog revealed that he carries two defective alleles of the NIPAL4 gene previously described in the American Bulldog. We performed a commercially available breed detection test which, although not specifically testing for &quot;American Bully&quot; signatures, revealed a high probability of American Bulldog DNA signature within the past three generations. Topical treatment using a combination of keratolytic and keratomodulator shampoo, emollient and moisturizers spray and antimicrobial wipes achieved a marked clinical improvement after only 1 month. Continuous topical treatment was necessary to maintain clinical improvement. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first description of the deleterious NIPAL4 variant in an American Bully as well as the first description of clinical management and follow-up of ARCI in this breed.">

The aim of this paper is to provide a critical and updated review on the management of FGIDs and their impact on the health of the infant and family to health care physicians. Guidelines and expert recommendations were reviewed. FGIDs are a frequent cause of parental concern, impairment in quality of life of infants and relatives, and impose a financial burden to families, health care, and insurance. Therefore, primary management of the FGIDs should be focused on improving the infants' symptoms and quality of life of the family. If more than parental reassurance is needed, available evidence recommends nutritional advice as it is an effective strategy and most of the time devoid of adverse effects. The role of healthcare providers in reassuring parents and proposing the correct behavior and nutritional intervention by avoiding inappropriate use of medication, is essential in the management of FGIDs.">

The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of treatment with Blephapad Combo with standard treatment. METHODS:We conducted 4-week, open-label, randomized controlled study with a closed sequential design at the Magna Graecia University of Catanzaro, Italy in which patients aged &gt; 40 years with symmetrical bilateral posterior blepharitis were enrolled. Each eye represented a single experimental unit. Patients were randomly assigned using a computer-generated randomization list to apply a reusable heated compress to the eyelid of one eye before cleansing the eyelid with the Blephapad Combo wet wipe (Blephapad Combo treatment arm) or to use the standard treatment of applying a wet and warm gauze to the other eye (standard treatment arm), twice daily for 4 weeks. The primary endpoint was the percentage change from baseline to week 4 in meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) grading scale scores. RESULTS:Eighteen patients (9 men; 9 women) with a mean (± standard deviation) age of 66.9 ± 9.03 years were included in the study. Compared with the eye receiving the standard treatment, treatment with Blephapad Combo appeared to improve the MGD total score after 4 weeks of treatment (mean change from baseline - 29.9 vs. - 38.5%). The assessment of the investigators was that in 11 patients the eye treated with Blephapad Combo showed greater benefit, in two patients the eye treated with the standard treatment showed greater benefit and in four patients there was no difference between treatments. Blephapad Combo was well tolerated, with no serious adverse events (AEs) reported. Minor ocular AEs were reported in 44.4 and 38.9% of patients in the Blephard Combo and standard treatment arms, respectively. CONCLUSIONS:Treatment with Blephapad Combo was more effective than the standard treatment in ameliorating MGD in patients with posterior blepharitis. Minor ocular AEs events were equally distributed between the two treatments arms. TRIAL REGISTRATION:ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03301844.">

Chemical sensitizers activate innate immune cells which orchestrate the skin immune response. This involves oxidative and inflammatory pathways. In parallel, the Nrf2/Keap1 pathway, a major ubiquitous regulator of cellular oxidative and electrophilic stress is activated in the different skin innate immune cells including epidermal Langerhans cells and dermal dendritic cells, but also in keratinocytes. In this context, Nrf2 shows a strong protective capacity through the downregulation of both the oxidative stress and inflammatory pathways.

Terpenes and the essential oils containing them are widely used and investigated by their pharmacological properties and permeation-enhancing ability. However, many terpenes and essential oils are sensitive to environmental conditions, undergoing volatilization and chemical degradation. In order to overcome the chemical instability of some isolated terpenes and essential oils, the encapsulation of these compounds in nanostructured systems (polymeric, lipidic, or molecular complexes) has been employed. In addition, nanoencapsulation can be of interest for pharmaceutical applications due to its capacity to improve the bioavailability and allow the controlled release of drugs. Topical drug administration is a convenient and non-invasive administration route for both local and systemic drug delivery. The present review focuses on describing the current status of research concerning nanostructured delivery systems containing isolated terpenes and/or essential oils designed for topical administration and on discussing the use of terpenes and essential oils either for their biological activities or as permeation enhancers in pharmaceutic formulations.">

The phenolic profile was determined using high-performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HPLC/ESI-MS), whereas a quantitative determination was also accomplished using the total phenolics assay. In vitro antioxidant activity was determined using the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl assay. Finally, volatile compounds were determined using headspace solid phase microextraction coupled to gas chromatography mass spectrometry (HS-SPME/GC-MS). The results showed that Lavandula stoechas aqueous extract had a slightly acidic pH, low salinity content and considerable electrochemical properties (electrical conductivity and liquid resistivity along with electric potential). In addition, aqueous fractions showed a significantly (p &lt; 0.05) higher phenolic content and in vitro antioxidant activity, whereas phenolic compounds, such as caffeic acid, quercetin-O-glucoside, lutelin-O-glucuronide and rosmarinic acid, were identified. Finally, numerous volatile compounds were found to dominate the volatile pattern of this flowering plant, producing a strong, penetrating, cool and menthol-like odour.">

From these, paramylon is already marketed as an immunostimulatory agent in nutraceuticals. Bioproducts from E. gracilis can be produced under various cultivation conditions discussed in this review, and their yields are relatively high when compared with those achieved in microalgal systems. Future challenges include achieving the economy of large-scale cultivation. Recent insights into the complex metabolism of E. gracilis have highlighted unique metabolic pathways, which could provide new leads for product enhancement by genetic modification of the organism. Also, development of molecular tools for strain improvement are emerging rapidly, making E. gracilis a noteworthy challenger for microalgae such as Chlorella spp. and their products currently on the market.">

While interest in herbs and spices as medicinal agents remains high and their use in foods continues to grow, there have been remarkably few studies that have attempted to track the dietary intake of herbs and spices and even fewer that have tried to find potential biomarkers of food intake (BFIs). The aim of the present review is to systematically survey the global literature on herbs and spices in an effort to identify and evaluate specific intake biomarkers for a representative set of common herbs and spices in humans. A total of 25 herbs and spices were initially chosen, including anise, basil, black pepper, caraway, chili pepper, cinnamon, clove, cumin, curcumin, dill, fennel, fenugreek, ginger, lemongrass, marjoram, nutmeg, oregano, parsley, peppermint and spearmint, rosemary, saffron, sage, tarragon, and thyme. However, only 17 of these herbs and spices had published, peer-reviewed studies describing potential biomarkers of intake. In many studies, the herb or spice of interest was administrated in the form of a capsule or extract and very few studies were performed with actual foods. A systematic assessment of the candidate biomarkers was also performed. Given the limitations in the experimental designs for many of the published studies, further work is needed to better evaluate the identified set of BFIs. Although the daily intake of herbs and spices is very low compared to most other foods, this important set of food seasoning agents should not be underestimated, especially given their potential benefits to human health.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Medicinal plants have been used traditionally since centuries for wound care and treatment of skin diseases both in human and animals. Skin diseases are one of the most common reasons for owners to take their dog to the veterinarian. The demands for treatment and prophylaxis of these diseases are broad. A wide range of bacteria including antibiotic-resistant bacteria can be involved, making the treatment challenging and bear an anthropo-zoonotic potential. The aim of this review is to systematically evaluate based on recent scientific literature, the potential of four medicinal plants to enrich the therapeutic options in pyoderma, canine atopic dermatitis, otitis externa, wounds and dermatophytosis in dogs. RESULTS:Based on four books and a survey among veterinarians specialized in phytotherapy, four medicinal plants were chosen as the subject of this systematic review: Calendula officinalis L. (Marigold), Hypericum perforatum L. agg. (St. John's Wort), Matricaria chamomilla L. (syn. Matricaria recutita L., Chamomile) and Salvia officinalis L. (Sage). According to the PRISMA statement through literature research on two online databases a total of 8295 publications was screened and narrowed down to a final 138 publications for which full-text documents were analyzed for its content resulting in a total of 145 references (21 clinical, 24 in vivo and 100 in vitro references). CONCLUSIONS:All four plants were proven to have antibacterial and antifungal effects of a rather broad spectrum including antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This makes them an interesting new option for the treatment of pyoderma, otitis externa, infected wounds and dermatophytosis. Marigold, St. John's Wort and Chamomile showed wound-healing properties and are thus promising candidates in line to fill the therapeutic gap in canine wound-healing agents. St. John's Wort and Chamomile also showed anti-inflammatory and other beneficial effects on healthy skin. Due to the wide range of beneficial effects of these medicinal plants, they should be taken into account for the treatment of dermatologic diseases in dogs at least in future clinical research.">

There was a dearth of consensus document on AD for Indian practitioners. This article aims to provide an evidence-based consensus statement for the management of AD with a special reference to the Indian context. This guideline includes updated definition, etiological factors, classification, and management of atopic dermatitis. Methodology:The preparation of guidelines was done in multiple phases. Indian Dermatology Expert Board Members (DEBM), recommended by the Skin Allergy Society of India, prepared 26 evidence-based recommendations for AD. An extensive literature search was done in MEDLINE, Google scholar, Cochrane, and other resources. Articles published in the past 10 years were reviewed and recommendations were graded based on the quality of evidence as per GRADE. After forming the initial structure, DEBM met in Mumbai and gave their decisions on an agree and disagree scale with an Indian perspective. Finally, their suggestions were compiled for preparing the article. After DEBM finalized the draft, a treatment algorithm was formulated for the management of AD. Results:DEBM suggested a working definition for AD. The panel agreed that moisturizers should be used as mainstay of therapy and should be continued in all lines of therapy and in maintenance phase. Topical corticosteroids and topical calcineurin inhibitors should be considered as the first line of treatment. Among systemic therapies, cyclosporin should be considered first line, followed by azathioprine, methotrexate, and mycophenolate mofetil. Phototherapy can be an effecive alternative. Empirical food restriction was recommended against. Conclusion:These guidelines should form a reference for the management of patients with AD in an evidence-based manner.">

Persons involved in spice agriculture and food industries are at greater risk since they are exposed to a considerable amount of combustible dust, which may be the cause of fire and explosion and adversely affect the health. These workers may experience allergy, long-term and short-term respiratory issues including occupational asthma, dermatitis, etc. Some spices induce T cell-based inflammatory reaction upon contact recognition of the antigen. Antigen Presenting Cells (APC) on binding to the causative metabolite results in activation of macrophages by allergen cytokine interleukin (IL)-12 and tumor necrosis factor-beta (TNF). Cross-reactivity for protein allergens is another factor which seems to be a significant trigger for the stimulation of allergic reactions. Thus, it was imperative to perform a systematic review along with bioinformatics based representation of some evident allergens has been done to identify the overall conservation of epitopes. In the present manuscript, we have covered a multifold approach, i.e., to categorize the spice particles based on a clear understanding about nature, origin, mechanisms; to assess metabolic reactions of the particles after exposure as well as knowledge on the conditions of exposure along with associated potential health effects. Another aim of this study is to provide some suggestions to prevent and to control the exposure up to some extent.">

Because of the limitation of resource and cultivation technology, fermentation of edible mushroom was gradually applied to nutrient, bioactivity and breeder seed preparation. At present, there are more reports on sugar and amino acid but less on other components. Morchella sp. YDJ-ZY-1 was isolated from the wild fruiting body by the spores releasing method in Zunyi Guizhou province in Southwest China and identified based on phenotype and genotype characteristics. Chemical compositions of YDJ-ZY-1 were investigated from liquid fermentation that will lay the foundation for further development and utilization. Four pyranoids (1-4) and 2-(1-oxo-2-hydroxyethyl) furan (5), linoleic acid (6), Morelin (2-hydroxy-cinnamic acid methyl ester, (7) and 1-O-β-d-ribofuranose-Morelin (8) were obtained from EtOAc extraction and elucidated by spectral data. Product 4 and 8 were new compounds and 7 was isolated from nature for the first time. Antiradical activity was evaluated by free radical scavenging effect on DPPH (1,1-Diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical 2,2-Diphenyl-1-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)hydrazyl). Compound 5 exhibited strong antiradical activity while compounds 1 and 2 exhibited moderate activity. Thus, incubation of Morchella sp YDJ-ZY-1 separated from the wild fruit body afforded eight compounds. Secondary metabolites with new structures were mined from fermentation of Morchella sp. and antiradical activity was evaluated.">

BV treatment upregulated the mRNA and protein levels of CD55 in THP-1 cells. Further experiments revealed that the phosphorylation of ERK was associated with upregulation of CD55. A complement-dependent cytotoxicity assay and a bacteria-killing assay showed that BV inactivated the complement system through the induction of CD55. The serum levels of C3 convertase (C3C) and Membrane attack complex (MAC) increased, while CD55 decreased in mice with AD-like lesions from DNCB treatment. However, the levels were inverted when the AD-like mice were treated with BV using subcutaneous injection, and we observed that the AD symptoms were alleviated. BV is often used to treat AD but its mechanism has not been elucidated. Here, we suggest that BV alleviates AD through the inactivation of the complement system, especially by the induction of CD55.">

        <span class="abst" title="Inactivating mutations of the tumor suppressor Adenomatosis Polyposis Coli (APC), which are found in familial adenomatosis polyposis and in 80% of sporadic colorectal cancers (CRC), result in constitutive activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and tumor development in the intestine. These mutations disconnect the Wnt/β-catenin pathway from its Wnt extracellular signal by inactivating the APC/GSK3-β/axin destruction complex of β-catenin. This results in sustained nuclear accumulation of β-catenin, followed by β-catenin-dependent co-transcriptional activation of Wnt/β-catenin target genes. Thus, mechanisms acting downstream of APC, such as those controlling β-catenin stability and/or co-transcriptional activity, are attractive targets for CRC treatment. Protein Kinase C-α (PKCα) phosphorylates the orphan receptor RORα that then inhibits β-catenin co-transcriptional activity. PKCα also phosphorylates β-catenin, leading to its degradation by the proteasome. Here, using both in vitro (DLD-1 cells) and in vivo (C57BL/6J mice) PKCα knock-in models, we investigated whether enhancing PKCα function could be beneficial in CRC treatment. We found that PKCα is infrequently mutated in CRC samples, and that inducing PKCα function is not deleterious for the normal intestinal epithelium. Conversely, di-terpene ester-induced PKCα activity triggers CRC cell death. Together, these data indicate that PKCα is a relevant drug target for CRC treatment.">

References are made to their applications in health-promoting and nutricosmetic products and the important public health implications that can be derived. Attention is focused on the colourless UV radiation (UVR)-absorbing dietary carotenoids phytoene and phytofluene, which are attracting increased interest in food science and technology, nutrition, health and cosmetics. These compounds are major dietary carotenoids, readily bioavailable, and have been shown to be involved in several health-promoting actions, as pinpointed in recent reviews. The growing evidence that these unique UVR-absorbing carotenoids with distinctive structures, properties (light absorption, susceptibility to oxidation, rigidity, tendency to aggregation, or even fluorescence, in the case of phytofluene) and activities can be beneficial in these contexts is highlighted. Additionally, the recommendation that the levels of these carotenoids are considered in properly assessing skin carotenoid status is made.">

Essential oils were recently proposed to increase drug effectiveness. Herein, we developed and optimized (23 full factorial design) Mediterranean essential oil (Rosmarinus officinalis, Lavandula x intermedia &quot;Sumian&quot;, Origanum vulgare subsp. hirtum) lipid nanoparticles for clotrimazole delivery, exploring the potential synergistic effects against Candida spp. Small sized nanoparticles (&lt;100 nm) with a very broad size distribution (PDI &lt; 0.15) and long-term stability were successfully prepared. Results of the in vitro biosafety on HaCaT (normal cell line) and A431 (tumoral cell line), allowed us to select Lavandula and Rosmarinus as anti-proliferative agents with the potential to be used as co-adjuvants in the treatment of non-tumoral proliferative dermal diseases. Results of calorimetric studies on biomembrane models, confirmed the potential antimicrobial activity of the selected oils due to their interaction with membrane permeabilization. Nanoparticles provided a prolonged in vitro release of clotrimazole. In vitro studies against Candida albicans, Candida krusei and Candida parapsilosis, showed an increase of the antifungal activity of clotrimazole-loaded nanoparticles prepared with Lavandula or Rosmarinus, thus confirming nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) containing Mediterranean essential oils represent a promising strategy to improve drug effectiveness against topical candidiasis.">

Several conditions such as telogen effluvium (TE), anagen effluvium, diffuse type of alopecia areata, female pattern hair loss, hair shaft abnormalities, loose anagen hair syndrome, and congenital atrichia or hypotrichosis are associated with hair loss. The actual prevalence rate of TE is not reported since most cases are subclinical in nature. Further, since women get more distressed by hair fall and promptly seek treatment, they tend to be over-represented. However, both genders can suffer from this condition if triggering factors are present. This consensus paper was developed by taking into account opinions of renowned experts in the field and is hoped to serve as an evidence-based platform for selecting efficacious and safe therapy for patients with TE. This review presents a synopsis of the key opinions of experts on all aspects of treatment and effective management of this condition.">

        <span class="abst" title="For a long time, the people of Saudi Arabia have been using medicinal plants (MPs) as conventional medicine to heal diverse human and livestock diseases. The present work is the first study on ethnobotanical uses of 124 MPs species used by the local tribal communities of Jazan province in the Southwest of Saudi Arabia. Ethnobotanical data were collected by interviewing 174 local informants using semistructured interviews. Informants of different ages, from several settlements belonging to several tribal communities, were interviewed. It is worth noticing that the age of informants and their knowledge of MPs were positively correlated, whereas the educational level and MP knowledge of participants were negatively correlated. To find out if there was agreement in the use of certain plants in the treatment of given ailments, we used Informant Consensus Factor (ICF). To determine the most frequently used plant species for treating a particular ailment category by local people we used the fidelity level (FL%). The Relative Frequency of Citation (RFC) was used to indicate the local importance of a species and the relative importance (RI) level was used to check the therapeutic potentials of the cited plants. A total of 124 MPs belonging to 103 genera and 48 families were collected and identified. The majority of these plants were shrubs (45%), perennial herbs (21%), annual herbs (19%), or trees (18%). The Asteraceae (10.48%), Fabaceae (7.25%), and Apocynaceae (7.25%) families were the most represented. Leaves, fruits, and whole plant (24%, 18%, and 16%, respectively) were the most used plant parts in formulating traditional medicines. Ziziphus spina-christi and Calotropis procera with the highest RI level (2.0) were found to have the highest range of therapeutic uses. They were followed by Datura stramonium (1.86), Withania somnifera, and Aloe vera (1.81). The ICF ranged from 0.02 to 0.42 covering 12 disease categories with a prevalence of disease categories related to skin and hair problems (ICF=0.42) having 75 species cited, while 73 species were cited for gastrointestinal tract (GIT) disorders (ICF = 0.40). Senna alexandrina (67%), Tribulus terrestris (64%), Pulicaria undulata (60%), Leptadenia pyrotechnica (55%), and Rumex nervosus (55%) had the highest FL which indicates their good healing potential against specific diseases. The high-FL species are the most promising candidate plants for in-depth pharmacological screening and merit further consideration. Accordingly, Jazan flora has good ethnobotanical potential. Unfortunately, many MP species are endangered by drought, overgrazing, and overexploitation. Some protection measures should be undertaken to prevent these species from becoming extinct. Natural reserves and wild nurseries are typical settings to retain medically important plants in their natural habitats, while botanic gardens and seed banks are important paradigms for ex situ conservation.">

The clinical relevance was assessed for all positive reactions. RESULTS:Positive patch test reactions to hydroperoxides of limonene and to hydroperoxides of linalool were observed in 77 patients (9.4%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.4%-11.4%) and in 96 patients (11.7%, 95%CI: 9.5%-13.9%), respectively; 38 of these patients (4.6%, 95%CI: 3.2%-6.0%) reacted to both. Most reactions were considered to be possibly or probably clinically relevant (66.3% and 68.8%, respectively), and a small proportion were deemed to be of certain clinical relevance (18.2% and 19.8%, respectively).

Plants are valuable sources of bioactive compounds. The present study investigates the chemical composition and antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anticancer activities of ethanolic extracts (EEs) and essential oils (EOs) from two species in the Lamiaceae family, Ocimum basilicum L. and Thymus algeriensis Boiss. &amp; Reut., cultivated in the Algerian Saharan Atlas. METHODS:The total flavonoid contents of the plants' ethanolic extracts were determined by the aluminium chloride method, while the total phenols were determined using the Folin-Ciocalteu method. Essential oils were obtained by hydrodistillation of the aerial parts of the plants and were analysed by GC-MS. The free radical-scavenging ability and antioxidant potential of the plants' EEs and EOs were probed using the 2, 2-diphenyl-picrylhydrazyl radical-scavenging, ABTS radical-scavenging, ferric-reducing power and phosphomolybdenum assays. The antimicrobial activities were evaluated against several pathogens characteristic of gram-negative bacteria (three species), gram-positive bacteria (three species) and fungi (two species). The microdilution method was used to estimate the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). The oils' anticancer potential against several cancer types was also studied using the MTT assay and reported as the toxic doses that resulted in a 50% reduction in cancer cell growth (LD50). RESULTS:Phenolic compounds in the EEs from both plants were analysed by HPLC and demonstrated a rich flavonoid content. Chemical analysis of the essential oil from Ocimum basilicum revealed 26 unique compounds, with linalool (52.1%) and linalyl acetate (19.1%) as the major compounds. A total of 29 compounds were identified in the essential oil from Thymus algeriensis, with α-terpinyl acetate (47.4%), neryl acetate (9.6%), and α-pinene (6.8%) as the major compounds. The ethanolic extracts and essential oils from both plants exhibited moderate antioxidant activities and moderate to weak antimicrobial activities. Furthermore, anticancer activities against the examined human cancer cell lines were associated with only the EOs from both plants, with LD50 values ranging between 300 and 1000 μg/mL. CONCLUSION:The results suggest that the bioactive compounds found in the ethanolic extracts and essential oils from Ocimum basilicum and Thymus algeriensis, with diverse antioxidant, antimicrobial and anticancer activities, may have beneficial applications in nutraceutical and pharmaceutical technologies.">

However, most studies provide conflicting results and the relationships between maternal preconceptional diet and risks of childhood asthma and allergic disease have not previously been explored. The objective of this study was to assess maternal diet during the year before pregnancy and the last 3 months of pregnancy and investigate their associations with the risks of asthma, wheezing, allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis in young children. Methods:The study sample consisted of 1140 mother-child pairs from the EDEN cohort. Mothers had responded to the food frequency questionnaires used to assess diet before and during pregnancy. Children were followed up using health questionnaires. The health outcomes studied were: asthma, wheezing, allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis by the age of 3 years. Results:Using multivariable-adjusted logistic regression models, significant inverse associations were observed between cooked green vegetable consumption before pregnancy and childhood asthma; consumption of eggs and raw vegetables before and during pregnancy, consumption of grains before pregnancy, and consumption of cooked green vegetables during pregnancy and allergic rhinitis. For the first time, a significant positive association was found between meat intake during the preconceptional period and a risk of wheezing, allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis. Conclusions:Based on our findings, preconceptional and prenatal maternal intake of certain type of food groups may be preventive against asthma, wheezing and allergic rhinitis, whereas higher maternal intake of meat before pregnancy may increase the risk of wheezing, allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis in young children.">

In contraposition, new studies reveal that fatty acids have an essential role for human health. The aim of the study is to demonstrate the clinical applications of fatty acids present in sea buckthorn oil. The composition of fatty acids found in sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides) oil is unique for this species, presenting a vast range of health benefits for humans and therefore it is highly valued by both biomedicine and the cosmetic industry. In this way, we will see the clinical effect of monounsaturated, polyunsaturated and saturated fatty acids that constitute sea buckthorn oil and how they contribute to the correct function of the organism. Despite there being studies that support the positive effects of sea buckthorn fatty acids, they are limited. Hence, most of the results obtained in this review are from studies of isolated fatty acids instead of fatty acids extracted from sea buckthorn oil. These facts permit to demonstrate the effect of sea buckthorn fatty acids separately but we lost the possibility of detecting a synergic effect of all of them. More studies are necessary to certify the clinical application of the fatty acids present in sea buckthorn oil as well as discovering possible synergies between them.">

        <span class="abst" title="The prevalence of allergic diseases such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, food allergy and atopic dermatitis has increased dramatically in recent decades. Conventional therapies for allergy can induce undesirable effects and hence patients tend to seek alternative therapies like natural compounds. Considering the fact above, there is an urgency to discover potential medicinal plants as future candidates in the development of novel anti-allergic therapeutic agents. The Lamiaceae family, or mint family, is a diverse plant family which encompasses more than 7,000 species and with a cosmopolitan distribution. A number of species from this family has been widely employed as ethnomedicine against allergic inflammatory skin diseases and allergic asthma in traditional practices. Phytochemical analysis of the Lamiaceae family has reported the presence of flavonoids, flavones, flavanones, flavonoid glycosides, monoterpenes, diterpenes, triterpenoids, essential oil and fatty acids. Numerous investigations have highlighted the anti-allergic activities of Lamiaceae species with their active principles and crude extracts. Henceforth, this review has the ultimate aim of compiling the up-to-date (2018) findings of published scientific information about the anti-allergic activities of Lamiaceae species. In addition, the botanical features, medicinal uses, chemical constituents and toxicological studies of Lamiaceae species were also documented. The method employed for data collection in this review was mainly the exploration of the PubMed, Ovid and Scopus databases. Additional research studies were obtained from the reference lists of retrieved articles. This comprehensive summarization serves as a useful resource for a better understanding of Lamiaceae species. The anti-allergic mechanisms related to Lamiaceae species are also reviewed extensively which aids in future exploration of the anti-allergic potential of Lamiaceae species.">

Intravenous soybean oil-based parenteral fat can exacerbate the risk of IFALD while intravenous fish oil can minimize its progression, yet the mechanisms by which soybean oil harms and fish oil protects the liver are uncertain. Properties that differentiate soybean and fish oils include α-tocopherol and phytosterol content. Soybean oil is rich in phytosterols and contains little α-tocopherol. Fish oil contains abundant α-tocopherol and little phytosterols. This study tested whether α-tocopherol confers hepatoprotective properties while phytosterols confer hepatotoxicity to intravenous fat emulsions. Utilizing emulsions formulated in the laboratory, a soybean oil emulsion (SO) failed to protect from hepatosteatosis in mice administered a PN solution enterally. An emulsion of soybean oil containing α-tocopherol (SO+AT) preserved normal hepatic architecture. A fish oil emulsion (FO) and an emulsion of fish oil containing phytosterols (FO+P) protected from steatosis in this model. Expression of hepatic acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), was increased in animals administered SO. ACC and PPARγ levels were comparable to chow-fed controls in animals receiving SO+AT, FO, and FO+P. This study suggests a hepatoprotective role for α-tocopherol in liver injury induced by the enteral administration of a parenteral nutrition solution. Phytosterols do not appear to compromise the hepatoprotective effects of fish oil.">

This single-blind randomized clinical trial was carried out on 60 infertile participants with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) willing to be pregnant. They were randomly allocated into group 1 (n = 20) who received routine dose of CC pills (50-150 mg) for three menstrual cycles from the fifth day of menstruation for five days; group 2 (n = 20) who consumed herbal mixture daily (700 mg); and group 3 (n = 20) who used up herbal mixture along with CC for 3 months. Catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), fasting blood sugar (FBS), insulin, and homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were measured in their blood samples. No statistically significant differences were observed between the three groups in terms of socio-demographic characteristics. After intervention, however, the levels of CAT in group 2 (adjusted mean difference (aMD): = 9.0; confidence interval (CI) 95% = 1.1-16.9) and group 3 (aMD = 12.2; CI 95% = 4.5-19.9), GPx in group 2 (aMD = 986.1; CI 95% = 141.1-1831.1) and group 3 (aMD = 1781.2; CI 95% = 960.7-2601.8), and SOD in group 2 (aMD = 55.1; CI 95% = 26.0-84.2) increased. While FBS in group 3 (aMD = -8.7; CI 95% = -14.7 to -2.7), insulin in group 2 (aMD = -5.6; CI 95% = -10.8 to -0.4), and HOMA-IR in group 2 (aMD = -1.3; CI 95% = -2.4 to -0.2) significantly decreased compared to the group 1. To summarize, herbal mixture supplements along with CC have beneficial effects on serum antioxidant levels, as well as glycemic biomarkers of infertile PCOS, menstrual regulation, and pregnancy rate.">

Prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) has emerged as a central inflammatory lipid mediator associated with increased migration, activation and survival of leukocytes in various allergy-associated disorders. In the periphery, the hematopoietic PGD synthase (hPGDS) acts downstream of the arachidonic acid/COX pathway catalysing the isomerisation of PGH2 to PGD2, which makes it an interesting target to treat allergic inflammation. Although much effort has been put into developing efficient hPGDS inhibitors, no compound has made it to the market yet, which indicates that more light needs to be shed on potential PGD2 sources and targets to determine which particular condition and patient will benefit most and thereby improve therapeutic efficacy. In this review, we want to revisit current knowledge about hPGDS function, expression in allergy-associated cell types and their contribution to PGD2 levels as well as beneficial effects of hPGDS inhibition in allergic asthma, rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, food allergy, gastrointestinal allergic disorders and anaphylaxis.">

        <span class="abst" title="Cutibacterium acnes (former Propionibacterium acnes), is a bacterium characterized by high genomic variability, consisting of four subtypes and six major ribotypes. Skin is the largest neuroendocrine organ of the human body and many cutaneous hormones and neurohormones can modulate bacterial physiology. Here, we investigated the effect of catecholamines, i.e., epinephrine and norepinephrine, on two representative strains of C. acnes, of which the genome has been fully sequenced, identified as RT4 acneic and RT6 non-acneic strains. Epinephrine and norepinephrine (10-6 M) had no impact on the growth of C. acnes but epinephrine increased RT4 and RT6 biofilm formation, as measured by crystal violet staining, whereas norepinephrine was only active on the RT4 strain. We obtained the same results by confocal microscopy with the RT4 strain, whereas there was no effect of either catecholamine on the RT6 strain. However, this strain was also sensitive to catecholamines, as shown by MATs tests, as epinephrine and norepinephrine affected its surface polarity. Flow cytometry studies revealed that epinephrine and norepinephrine are unable to induce major changes of bacterial surface properties and membrane integrity. Exposure of sebocytes to control or catecholamine-treated bacteria showed epinephrine and norepinephrine to have no effect on the cytotoxic or inflammatory potential of either C. acnes strains but to stimulate their effect on sebocyte lipid synthesis. Uriage thermal spring water was previously shown to inhibit biofilm production by C. acnes. We thus tested its effect after exposure of the bacteria to epinephrine and norepinephrine. The effect of the thermal water on the response of C. acnes to catecholamines depended on the surface on which the biofilm was grown. Finally, an in-silico study revealed the presence of a protein in the genome of C. acnes that shows homology with the catecholamine receptor of Escherichia coli and eukaryotes. This study suggests that C. acnes may play a role as a relay between stress mediators (catecholamines) and acne.">

Here, we found that IL-10+ Breg cells suppress the activation of IL-13-producing type 2 innate lymphoid cells (IL-13+ ILC2s) in an IL-10-dependent manner in mice with oxazolone-induced severe contact hypersensitivity (CHS). Mast cell (MC) IL-5 was important for maintaining the population of IL-10+ Breg cells in peripheral lymphoid tissues.

        <span class="abst" title="Plants have been used for years for various cosmetic purposes. In the Eastern Cape province of South Africa, a large proportion of the population reliant (to some extent) on botanical resources for beauty and health. Despite the use of these botanical resources for various cosmetic purposes, only a few have been fully commercialized or used as ingredients in cosmetic formulation. The present study aimed to review plant species that are fully explored commercially for cosmetic products in the Eastern Cape province. A survey of cosmetic products with plant-based ingredients was done covering the major supermarkets (SPAR, Shoprite, and Pick n Pay), cosmetic shops (Clicks), and pharmacies in the Eastern Cape province, and electronic databases including Embase, Google Scholar, Medline, PubMed, Scopus, SciFinder®, Springer, Science Direct, and Web of Science were used as data sources for ethnobotanical information. Surprisingly, out of 150 plant species used by both Xhosa men and women for various cosmeceutical purposes, only six plant species have been used commercially with regard to cosmeceutical application. These plants species belong to five major plant families, namely Lamiaceae (two species), Asphodelaceae (one species) Cucurbitaceae (one species), Oleaceae (one species), and Verbenaceae (one species). The findings revealed that the use of Eastern Cape plants for cosmetic purposes has not been fully explored commercially. Thus, there is a need for cosmeceutical industries to explore these species commercially in order to develop new possible cosmetic products for local and international markets.">

The classic approach to wound management is represented by topical treatments, such as antibacterial or colloidal agents, in order to prevent infection and promote a proper wound-healing process. Nanotechnology studies submicroscopic particles (maximum diameter of 100 nm), as well as correlated phenomena. Metal nanoparticles (e.g., silver, gold, zinc) are increasingly being used in dermatology, due to their beneficial effect on accelerating wound healing, as well as treating and preventing bacterial infections. Other benefits include: ease of use, less frequent dressing changes and a constantly moist wound environment. This review highlights recent findings regarding nanoparticle application in wound management.">

To limit this emerging public health problem, there is a need to develop non-incursive, non-toxic, and new antimicrobial techniques that act more effectively and quicker than the current antibiotics. One of these effective techniques is antibacterial photodynamic therapy (aPDT). This review focuses on the application of porphyrins in the photo-inactivation of bacteria. Mechanisms of bacterial resistance and some of the current 'greener' methods of synthesis of meso-phenyl porphyrins are discussed. In addition, significance and limitations of aPDT are also discussed. Furthermore, we also elaborate on the current clinical applications and the future perspectives and directions of this non-antibiotic therapeutic strategy in combating infectious diseases.">

The chemical structures were proven depending upon spectroscopic analysis, including FTIR, HRFABMS, and 1D/2D-NMR. The chemotaxonomic significance of the isolated compounds, especially diterpenes from E. sanctae-catharinae compared to those documented from different Euphorbia species was also studied via agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC). The Egyptian endemic Euphorbia sanctae-catharina was grouped with E. bupleuroides, E. fidjiana, E. fischeriana, E. pithyusa subsp. cupanii, E. prolifera, and E. seguieriana, where myrsinol diterpenoids were the characteristic compounds.">
